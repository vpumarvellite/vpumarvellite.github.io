<h1>Miria and Wiki</h1>

<h2>TRIBUTE TO WIKI</h2>

<p>"Kei hea ke a Wiki?" This was a question heard often during the Silver Jubilee celebrations. It was the first question of visiting priests who remembered Wiki as our main speaker and host. "How is his health now?"</p>

<p>To the young people - Tena ra koutou te Rangatahi - I would like to introduce you to Wiki Hotere and tell you some of his achievements over the years. Some years back Wiki suffered a stroke that almost killed him. He struggled back from that sickness, but these days he finds it hard to cope with crowds. But he asked me to tell you that you were all in his thoughts and prayers at this time.</p>

<p>Wiki is one of the enormous Hotere family who have been great supporters of the Hahi Matua for many generations. His father was Hipiriona William Barney of Matihetihe, Te Rarawa & Ngati Whatua. He was working in the gumfields, age 16, when he eloped with Akinihi, from Whirinaki. She was only 15. But love conquers all.</p>

<p>They married and raised a family of ten boys and one girl. Barney, as he was known to all, was one of that tough breed of men, the bullock driver. The advent of the tractor meant there was very little work for the bullock teams. I once watched a team of six bullocks pulling a small house onto a barge at Whakarapa. How smoothly they worked! What a pity such artistry disappeared! But life moves on, and Barney and Akinihi moved with the family to Taumarunui to find suitable work.</p>

<p>It was good training in Tikanga Maori for the young family to grow up among Ngati Maniapoto and Ngati Tuwharetoa, with customs markedly different from Hokianga. This experience would stand Wiki in good stead, as he travelled the country later in his work for the Faith.</p>

<p>Eventually, in 1951, the family moved to Auckland where there was work on the wharves. They were also welcomed by the growing Catholic Maori community. They were trained Katekita who could lead the Karakia o te Miha and all the other community prayers. (Without the need for a book!) Wiki became more and more a spiritual leader in the days of the Miha Maori in St Patrick's school in Wellington Street.</p>

<p>On January 15th, 1953, Wiki and Kohumiria (Nepia) of Ngati Ranginui were married in St Pat's Cathedral with Pa Tewano officiating. The Reception was held at the Maori Community Centre in Fanshawe Street.</p>

<p>Miria was not only a wonderfully kind person, but she was a great inspirer of people and she had a glorious voice. When Barney senior died in 1954 Miria led us in the No te hohonutanga. There were more than twenty priests at the Requiem Mass and none of us will forget the sound of her voice echoing through the Cathedral.</p>

<p>They set up house in Wellington Street. It was not very flash, but it was a centre to which the young people gravitated. They were both involved in the Legion Of Mary and did a lot of work, visiting homes and praying with families, keeping them in touch with their Faith.</p>
