    <p>
        Martha was an early member of Rangimarie and
        went everywhere for Concerts and Christ the
        Maori. She was also very active in fund-raising.
        She and Sadie Hussey used to gather great bales
        of second-hand clothes to make money for the
        projects at Te Unga Waka. One day she got
        worried that Sadie hadn't phoned for a few days,
        so she called Bobby Newson and Pa Ryan. They
        climbed in the window and found Sadie lying there
        quite dead, with her little dog who was very
        pleased to see us. The house was stacked with
        second-hand clothing for the next money-raising effort.

    <p>
        There were sad moments in her life, but she
        transformed them by her faith. Now she lies in
        Waihapa, with nephew Teddy and sister Mary,
        both of whom she looked after for many years.
    </p>

    <p>
        God bless you dear "Auntie" – we know you are
        still being an Auntie for us in heaven.
