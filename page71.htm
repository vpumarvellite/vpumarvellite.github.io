  <h1>Pa Petera</h1>
  <h2>Deacon at Te Unga Waka</h2>

  <p>Tena koutou te iwi o Te Unga Waka. All my best wishes to you on the occasion of your Silver Jubilee.</p>

  <p>My connection with Te Unga Waka began when Bishop Mackey thought it would be good if Pat Dunn and I had three months each at Te Unga Waka, as deacons, before ordination. That was from November 1975 through to January 1976, Pa Geboers was number 1 then. I think Pa Gerry Mertens went away soon after I arrived!</p>

  <p>My first Saturday there, I had to go out to a house-warming in Avondale/New Lynn with Gerry and Jim McGrath, followed by a hangi, then a wedding at Te Atatu and another hangi. Then I remember just getting back to Renall Street - to spend half an hour on the loo!</p>

  <p>I enjoyed my time there (Te Unga Waka of course!). I remember Rangimarie, with Manu and family and Pio and Chrissy, and Volley Ball on Fridays nights at Waka.</p>

  <p>- A week-end with Janus (Pa Ateriona) down to Taumarunui, to open the Meeting House where two of the poupou had been carved by him. (I first met Jim Bolger there.)</p>
  <p>- Going out to Mangere and visiting homes with Margaret Stininato with her "little" boys in tow.</p>
  <p>- Trying to learn a little Maori language with help of the families.</p>
  <p>- The busload of people who came through to Te Aroha for my Ordination - much appreciated.</p>
  <p>- The Sunday 11am Masses with the meal afterwards.</p>
  <p>- Hans (Pa Hani) playing cards at Waka; warm Mill Hill hospitality.</p>
  <p>- Becky and Waimarie cooking and house-keeping for us at Manukau Road, with Becky's Mum, Marion.</p>

  <p>- Buying my first car, a Viva that Mick Ryan had owned - via McHugh himself for $2,400 (when the maximum you could borrow from the Clergy Trust Fund was $2,500). It went well till Easter 1977, when I cracked the head on the way to Taupo.</p>
  <p>- Playing golf with Pa Geboers at Chamberlain Park.</p>
  <p>- Housie at Waka on Thursday nights.</p>

  <p>All these thoughts come rushing to mind when I think of those days. The only trouble with them - they went too quickly. Remember me to all my old friends - some of them have gone to their rest. We say good-bye to them, and to the kanohi ora may I say <i>Kia kaha! Kia maia!</i> (Is my Maori O.K.?)</p>

  <p>Aroha nui,</p>

  <h1>Father Sullivan</h1>
  <h2>Te Unga Waka â€“ My Whare Wananga</h2>

  <p>To the Catholic Maori people of Auckland and especially to my whanaunga at Te Unga Waka, best wishes for your Silver Jubilee Celebrations. He mihi nui ki a koutou, aku kuia, koroua me te whanau katoa i tenei wa hari nui.</p>

  <p>I believe the Holy Spirit is leading you to do brave and exciting work in the next bracket of years. Can we get closer to you in our Suburban Parishes?</p>

  <p>I am always grateful for the "finishing off" work you did in my time with you - as a Deacon and a New Priest. The "Maori Mission" is a special Seminary, a true "Wananga".</p>

  <p>Many Blessings! Kia nui nga manaaki a te Runga Rawa ki a koutou katoa.</p>

  <p>Aroha nui,</p>
