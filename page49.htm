<h1>On The Good Old Clevedon Clipper</h1>

<p>But mostly our Ope travelled by the good old Clevedon Clipper bus or by using the Auckland Regional or Whenuapai Buses. They became our regular, once a month, means of transport. We had to limit it to once a month for trips out of Auckland. Kaitaia, Dargaville, Taumarunui, Gisborne, Te Kaha, Tauranga, Mangakino and many more names became familiar to us.</p>

<p>First of all we would work out the distance and the probable time it would take. Then we would look at the performance time and work back from that, to make sure we started early enough. If the venue was north of Whangarei or south of Hamilton, it meant a late Friday night departure. Usually we set out about midnight to arrive in the early hours of Saturday. That would give us time to rest before the afternoon or evening performance.</p>

<p>Every presentation had to be considered on its own. There were always different elements. Was everyone available? Would we stay on a marae or board out or even (on odd occasions) sleep in the bus? What were the travel costs? What type of people would be our audience?</p>

<p>At Te Kaha, for example, we performed for the Whanau-a-Apanui on the verandah, the Mahau of the beautiful carved meeting house, Tukaki. We felt the peaceful presence of Tukaki and his father Apanui after whom the people are named. In Taupo we had trouble with the stage, but we worked on it, and the performance was excellent.</p>

<p>During these visits our whanau always grew bigger. Within a very short time our new acquaintances had become part of the wider whanau - friends who would keep in touch for years. And of course everywhere we would meet "long-lost" relations, our own kith and kin.</p>

<p>On the Sunday mornings, an early breakfast would be allowed by Miha Maori then a hakari - and then the farewells - Nga Mihi Poroporoaki! A song or two from our hosts and a song or three from us - and we soon forgot the planned time of departure. Te Ropu Rangimarie gained experience and knowledge from every trip. Right from the beginning we decided that this was not just another play or concert, it was a religious experience. We were privileged to portray Christ and his Whanau. We took them with us on every expedition. It was a Spiritual Retreat. That was why we put ourselves under strict rules of no strong drink and exemplary behaviour.</p>
