<h2>Maori Wardens</h2>

<p>Some of our own people got very vocal about who should shake the Pope’s hand, who would give the first karanga. We had invited the leaders of the different Maori hahi to meet him and some of our Catholic people felt they should have preference. But we have to explain to them that this was the wish of the Holy Father who sees his work as breaking down the barriers which divide us.</p>

<p>Another problem was security. We didn’t want police control. We claimed that our Maori Wardens would be enough, and they did a great job alright. There was such a crowd of people though, that at one time one of his personal guards was calling out, “I’ve lost him, I can’t see him!”</p>

<p>The Pope’s message to us as a people was full of wisdom and guidance for the future. We were also impressed with his Maori pronunciation. (We didn’t know at the time that one of our priests had been helping him with tape recordings).</p>

<p>I’ll leave the photos to tell the rest of the story. It was a high point in our lives and the effort was all worthwhile.</p>

<p class="maori-greeting"> No reira, me mutu iho enei korero. E mihi tonu ana ki a koutou katoa i tenei wa Tiuperi. Tena koutou me te aroha nui.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I wish to extend special greetings to you the Maori people of Aotearoa. And to thank you for your cordial ceremonial welcome.</p>
<p>The strengths of Maori Culture are often the very values which modern society is in danger of losing; an acknowledgement of the spiritual dimension in every aspect of life; a profound reverence for nature and the environment; a sense of community, assuring every individual that he or she belongs; loyalty to family and a great willingness to share; an acceptance of death as part of life and a capacity to grieve and mourn death in a human way. As you rightly treasure your culture, let the Gospel of Christ continue to penetrate and permeate it, confirming your sense of identity as a unique part of God’s household. It is as Maori that the Lord calls you. It is as Maori that you belong to the Church, the one Body of Christ.”</p>
