  <h2>Our "Big" Chiefs, Kevin, Toi and Bob</h2>

  <p>I also want to give a plug for the younger generation.
  The spirit which built Te Unga Waka is alive and well in
  Te Hauauru (West of Auckland.) Young leaders like Toi
  (Son of Martha and Dan) have matured in both Maori and
  Spiritual ways. Kevin Ngakuru and his wife Gina make
  their home into a marae and their garage into a church.
  Bob Newson still likes to think he's a spring chicken!, but
  he and Gemma have that same spirit of helping others
  that they had in the Te Unga Waka Youth.</p>

  <p>It's a mistake to start mentioning names, because I'm
  bound to miss out someone and they'll never speak to
  me again! But I must mention our young artist Masepa
  Edwards. She used her artistic talents so effectively in Te
  Whau.</p>

  <p>I need not mention Mike Tipene, because he's getting
  kaumatua like me. But he doesn't do too badly in training
  the young people with their weekly meetings.
  I take off my hat to them all and say, the future is in
  good hands.</p>

  <p>God bless you, everyone.<br>
  Aroha nui</p>
