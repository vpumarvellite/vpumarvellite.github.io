  <h2>Pa Pere</h2>

  <p>
    He's Bishop Denis' Vicar for Maori Affairs, He's Bishop Takuira's "legman" for the Maori Pastoral Plan, he's a guiding hand at Hato Petera, and of course every no-hoper rings up and says "I'm a cousin of Pa Henare" (with the implication - "so you'd better treat me right!") Apologies to his real cousins who are very numerous - but the real ones keep quiet about it, because otherwise he'll be sure to give them a job to do.

    Pa Pere (Father Bernard Dennehy) is another Diocesan priest who has joined the Team at Te Unga Waka. He is a dinkum New Zealander. He was born in Dunedin, but did his secondary schooling at Sacred Heart College, Auckland. He was ordained priest for the Auckland Diocese in 1964 and worked for the first four years in Ponsonby Parish. He then volunteered for work in South American and for the next eight years his home was in Peru. He became fluent in Spanish and visited several of the countries of South America, having a first-hand look at the social conditions in those countries. On his return to New Zealand he preferred to work among the Maori people and looked after the parish of Dargaville and later Pawarenga. So that gave him a good introduction to the people he would meet in Tamaki.

  <h2>Kaiarahi</h2>

    Our family of Te Unga Waka has always used Katekita (Catechists) to lead the Maori prayers. It was also part of their work to help priests who did not speak Maori, and to guide them in any Maori situation. This was especially useful in Auckland city, with over 40 parishes, some of which have over a hundred Catholic Maori families living in them. After Vatican II, every parish was urged to involve lay people in the work of the parish. This applied also to Pakeha parishes. People were taught not only to lead public prayer, but also to give Holy Communion and take Communion to the sick. Some of our older Katekita did not feel ready for all these changes and they preferred to keep to their role of Prayer Leader. But other younger people including ladies, came forward. They attended classes and learned all that was involved in their sharing to the priestly ministry. It was a revelation to hear some of the quiet, humble people speak of their faith. We began to use the term Kaiarahi - Leader, to indicate this new role.

Bishop Mackey came personally to present the first group with their symbols of authority. As a symbol of acceptance by the people, our Chairman at the time, Pio Jacobs, placed the Korowai on their shoulders. This has been repeated with Bishop Denis, who also used the symbol of the Hoe Urungi (The Steering Oar). Each time the same three elements were involved, the stepping forward by the Candidate, the giving of the Church's authority, and the public acceptance. Recently, the public acceptance included the coming forward of every member of the congregation, old and young, to place their hands on the head of each new Kaiarahi. Knowing our people, you will understand that this included hugs and kisses and congratulations.

    Now each Sunday, two Kaiarahi take it in turn to prepare everything for Mass at Te Unga Waka. They appoint readers, hymn leader etc. and then welcome everyone with the proper Maori etiquette. Eventually we hope to have a Kaiarahi for every Whanau in the city. This will be a great advantage for family huihuinga, for preparing the young for the Sacrements and for preserving the Faith of the next generation.
