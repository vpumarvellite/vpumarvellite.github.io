<h1>The Auckland Catholic Maori Society</h1>

<p>When the Auckland Catholic Maori Society was formed in 1961, Wiki was chosen as Secretary. Dame Whina was President for the first five years, till after the opening of Te Unga Waka. She then had to give up, owing to so many other commitments. Laurence Petricevich took over for a couple of years with Wiki as Secretary. When Laurence retired, Wiki was elected President, with Tai Patrick as Secretary.</p>

<p>In these years a lot of changes were taking place in the Church. In 1962 Pope John 22nd called the first session of the Vatican Council. The Whanau of Jesus from all around the World, represented by the Bishops, took a completely fresh look at the way we were presenting Jesus and his message. The Maori world had received the message of Christ, clothed in the words and ideas of the nineteenth century. And the priests still had to use the ancient colonial language of the Roman Empire, namely Latin. The Council decreed that local languages could and should be used.</p>

<p>The Auckland Bishops leaned heavily on the Auckland Catholic Maori Society to give them good advice with regard to Maori input into the liturgy. Cardinal Delargy and, after him, Bishop John Mackey would ring up Wiki or call him for consultation.</p>

<p>We have grown used to the changes now, but things like evening Masses, joining in prayer with people of other faiths, the removal of the regulations about fasting and abstinence from meat, more positive stress on personal prayer and studies of Holy Scripture, etc., were all making us feel a bit insecure. To some it meant the END - the Rock of Peter was crumbling! To others it meant a fresh wind was blowing the cobwebs away. To others it meant "Do What You Like".</p>

<p>Now Wiki had to face up to these attitudes. With June Mclntosh they were representatives on the Commission of the Laity in 1970. This was a nation-wide Commission. It then became obvious that the Maori people needed to have their own national group to advise the Bishops and Church Leaders. This was inaugurated in 1972 with Wiki as the first Chairman.</p>

<p>But it was a sad year for Wiki. Miria had been fighting cancer for many months and in November she gave up the unequal fight and went to join her loved ones ki tua te arai. There was such a crowd at the Requiem Mass we had to have it in the Hall. Wiki read the lesson with such emotion and meaning that there wasn't a dry eye among the listeners. And at Waikumete we sang all the songs that she had taught us. The hymns and songs went on and on. No one wanted to leave.</p>

<p>Panapa was thirteen and Catherine just ten at the time. It was good that Auntie Cecilia Lundon was on hand to help with their upbringing.</p>
