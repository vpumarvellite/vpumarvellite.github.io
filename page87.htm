<h2>The Holy Father</h2>

<p>It was a learning period for us. (I don’t think we ever stop learning.) It could be for a Maori event or for a church happening. So many of our people have only a slight connection with their parishes, and they would want us to give them a lead. They felt comfortable with us, because we were their relations and they could reveal their real feelings to us. It was hard work, carrying other peoples’ burdens and trying to help them understand the new insights into faith.</p>

<p>I’ll hand over to Pio now to talk about a special event in our lives.</p>


<p class="maori-greeting">Ara, te taenga mai o to tatou Hepara Nui, ko Hoane Paora te Tuarua.</p>

<p class="maori-greeting">Kia ora. Me tautoko ahau i nga kupu mihi i mihia nei e toku hoa rangatira. He mihi whanui ki a koutou, tena ra koutou katoa.</p>

<p>We are never likely to forget the coming of the Pope to Aotearoa. Our committee felt that we had a big responsibility on our shoulders, because we wanted the Maori people to be proud of our welcome. But we had to guide our waka through many shoals to get everything right.</p>

<p>First of all we had to get the blessing of Ngati Whatua, because it was on their whenua that we would greet the Pope. They were most helpful. Doc Wikiriwhi joined our group to help us with the protocol. Then our troubles started. We were given a nice sloping area, next to the place where the Pope would say Mass. But after a while we were moved up and away to the top of the ridge. We tried to make the best of it to align our site towards Potatau and the Whare Taonga. In the meantime, the shelter for the Pope was being prepared in Penrose. This was to represent the Kotuku – the White Heron of Single Flight. Unfortunately the measurements had been misinterpreted and the Kotuku was so high you couldn’t see what it was supposed to be.</p>

<p>Then the tumuaki pakeha said we should re-align our area, to angle it back towards the main crowd area. But we were getting stubborn by now, so he went away breathing fire and saying, “We’ll see about that!” The Mayor’s office was also getting stroppy saying that Kath Tizard had to be the first to shake hands with the Pope, because she represented the city. In the end Barry Curtis managed to side-step that, by inviting her to come along with him and greet the Pope at the Airport.</p>

<p>In the middle of all this I had a dream. He tino moemoea – e heke mai ana nga kaumatua i te ngahere, ara nga kaumatua no nga wa o mua. Ko te mutunga, ko te kaumatua o te whakaahua ra, e mau potae ana, e kai paipa ana, a, e kata ana. Ka mea mai ia ki ahau, “Kei te pai, kei te tika!” I had never known these old people, but I sort of recognised them in the dream. I think we all felt better after this, especially when Sir James Henare gave us his full support.</p>
