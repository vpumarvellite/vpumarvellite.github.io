    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <pre>
He wahi mihi, ki a koutou katoa, nga hoa, nga whanaunga o te whanau o Te Unga Waka.
Tena ra koutou, huri noa te motu. Nga kanohi ora, tena koutou katoa. Me Koutou hoki kua
nunumi ki tua o te arai, ekore koutou e wareware ake ake. Haere ki te unga o nga waka,
Haere ki te wa kainga o to tatou Ariki o Hehu Karaiti. Haere, haere, haere.

The only time people read a Preface is when they can't understand what the book is
about. So, just briefly, this is a book of memories. It's like a Family Album of Photos. It
may not be of much interest to others, but to family and friends, it's great fun.

It took a long time to gather together the old photos ... at least that's my excuse
and to tap into the writing talents of the different authors, all of whom were part of the
events narrated here ... and to make sure we got the names right on the photos. If you
find any mistakes, tell them to the person who's going to do the Golden Jubilee
Magazine. By that time, most of us will have been gathered by the strong hand of aitua.
So here and now I leave all my photos to that person, and hope you all do the same, so
that the next generation can enjoy them.

Kia ora,
Kia tupu tonu.

Naku noa,
Na Pa Ryan
