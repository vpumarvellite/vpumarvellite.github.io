<p>As I write this, I hear the voices coming from the past - Mere Daniels, Martha Cash, my own darling Julie, little baby Jesus (Heremaia Nicholls), Cecilia Wharewaka, Noa Waiti, Tom Waru who left us just recently, and so many of our loved ones. We say to them:</p>

<pre>
Haere ra kotou katoa. 
Haere ki te Ropu Waiata o nga Ahere. 
A te wa e whakaritea ai e to tatou Ariki, ka kite ano tatou i a tatou, ka waiata ano tatou i a tatou. 
Kia kite-a-kanohi koutou i te Karaiti, kia kaha te waiata ki a ia.
Me tatou hoki nga kanohi ora. Tena ano koutou nga morehu o te hunga kua moe. Kia kaha tatou ki te whai atu i o ratou tapuwae. 
Tena koutou, tena koutou, a, tena kotou katoa.</p>

<p>(And a couple of reminiscences from Dolly)
When we took CHRIST THE MAORI to Paremoremo we were a bit nervous. The audience sat up stiffly, with arms folded. Most of them looked bored. The people who knew Pa Henare and who had invited us to come, were looking a bit worried. I suppose they were hoping that the prisoners would behave themselves and give us a respectful hearing. There was security everywhere, which made us more nervous than ever. But we need not have been. Those hard men were really touched by the play. Afterwards, we were pretty sure they went without their evening kai, so that the manuhiri could be treated properly and have a meal to end the visit.

On one occasion (it could have been at Tauranga), there was an old kuia in the front row. She had been ill for a long time and the doctors said she only had a month or two to live. She told the people around her that she had been to all the doctors and healers and tohungas, but without any luck, so now she was coming to Christ himself. She was so moved by the performance that she really joined in the tangi for Christ's death. That tangi always got to us too, no matter how many times we performed the play. We might say: "I'm sure I won't cry tonight," but we always ended up crying real tears. At the end of the play, she came up and asked Pio if they could just touch him and say a prayer. Christ must have helped them because they came to several other performances over the years, when their finances allowed. They always sat in the front row.
