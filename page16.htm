    <h1>QUEEN CAMPAIGN RESULTS</h1>
    <p>
        The next was City 2 with £715.3.4d. Martha Karanga was declared elected with Cecilia Lundon the runner-up. Can you still remember the old way of counting money? To get an idea, remember that in the early nineteen sixties an average weekly wage for a carpenter was £14, for a farm labourer £7. The grand total for the campaign was £4,190—a lot of weeks' wages.

        The coronation took place a week later, in the Maori Community Centre in Pitt Street. It might not have been Westminster Abbey, but there was a real Archbishop to do the crowning. For an hour and a half, each group performed action songs, haka and poi and kept the crowds in high spirits. Then Colonel Arapeta Awatere went forward as Kaituki to challenge the Queen's party. When Queen Martha was safely seated on her throne he presented her with a ceremonial mere of authority. The Archbishop then came forward to place the crown on her head. She in turn presented him with a Treasure Chest containing £2,000 as a "foundation stone" towards the Centre. The rest was put aside for the expenses of the Ordination.

        Some of the Queens were at the Silver Jubilee celebration. Queen Martha Karanga left for Australia some years ago and lives in Perth.

    <h2>CENTRAL COMMITTEE</h2>
    <p>
        All this effort pulled the people together. A central committee was formed with representatives from the seven groups which had supported the different Queens. This was to unify the efforts and oversee the organisation. Dame Whina, Wiki Hotere and Pa Matiu were the leaders.

    <h2>MISSION AT ST BENEDICT'S</h2>
    <p>
        As part of the spiritual preparation, Father Huia Hyde suggested that St. Benedict's should be used for a spiritual "Mission". Missions had already been held at St. Benedict's. It was big and central. But this one would be specifically for Maori people to prepare them spiritually for the ordination.

        It was to run from Sunday, 29th April to Sunday, 6th May. Priests from outside of Auckland were invited. However, owing to sickness, only Pa Kereti Cushlow was available for all the weekday evening services. Everyone liked his style of preaching with stories and jokes to illustrate his points. But he confesses all these years later that it was a tough assignment.

        Liza Tipene and her fellow Legionairies would all sit on the front rows, drinking in every word. Every evening hundreds of people came in, even from distant suburbs. The Legion of Mary did a great job, delivering by hand over one thousand invitations to every Catholic family in Auckland. The priests on the scene were kept busy with the sacrament of Reconciliation. Over 700 came to each of the two Sunday Masses.
