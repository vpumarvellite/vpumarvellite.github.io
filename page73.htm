    In the years when our families were first settling in Auckland, the Legion of Mary played an important
    part in keeping us in touch with each other. In these days our youngsters might wonder what the title
    "Legion of Mary" means. So let me give you a little explanation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Legion was started in Ireland by a layman, Frank Duff in the 1920s. Its philosophy is based on the
    place of Mary in the life of Jesus. If Jesus could trust her so completely to live nine months in her womb
    and spend his childhood at her knee, his respect for her is still the same. So the group which he founded
    would work with Mary to bring people to her son Jesus. It was an association run by ordinary people
    with the help of a priest as chaplain.
  </p>

  <p>
    The name was taken from the Roman Army, called the Legion. Different titles were also taken from the
    same source. For example, each local group was called a Praesidium which was the name given to a
    special Task Force in the Roman Legion. But this was to be an army for God, armed only with the
    weapons of prayer and aroha.

    Pa Tewano (Fr O'Callaghan) introduced the Maori Legion in Auckland, with Charlotte Cassidy as the first
    President. To be a Legionary you had a three months trial period. You attended the weekly, 90 minutes
    meeting, said the daily prayers of the Legion and did two hours work in the week. We used St Patrick's
    as our centre. We gathered there to give our reports and be given our work for the coming week. We had
    to study the handbook to imbibe the proper Legion spirit. We were, "Sister Topia, Brother Hotere, etc ..."
    to each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first thing we learned was the spiritual character of the work. We visited hospitals and homes,
    Mt Eden prison and Oakley Mental Home. It also included doing door to door census in the city. Pa
    Tewano, by himself, could never discover all the new Catholic families coming into the City, but with our
    backing, he knew where most people were.
