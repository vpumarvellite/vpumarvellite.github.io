  <p>The Credit Union did good work for several years and tribute must be paid to the workers who collected the weekly payments. It helped families to furnish their homes. Unfortunately, the rules were not strictly adhered to and bad debts began to accumulate. In spite of the efforts made – especially those of the late Molly Houpapa – it had to close down. God bless you Molly for your valiant efforts.</p>
