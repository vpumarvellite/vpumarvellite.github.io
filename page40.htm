<h1>Waitaruke</h1>

<pre>
Ko Ngati Kahu tenei mihi atu nei ki a koutou, te iwi o Te Unga Waka. 
Tena koutou i tenei tau tiuperi - 25 o nga tau. 
E mihi tonu ana ahau ki a koutou mo te manaaki ki nga Manuhiri i te wiki o te Tiuperi; te pai hoki o nga Hui Karakia, o nga Konohete, o nga kai hakari.</p> 

<p style="text-align:left;">Many congratulations to all who made it possible. Te Unga Waka didn't exist when I did a spell in Auckland. I was given this huge area to look after, mainly to the East and South of the city.  If I'd counted the number of cups of tea I drank in the course of a day, it would be in the Guinness Book of Records.  The idea was to set up Committees in each significant area where our Maori people could come together for a Miha Maori.  Each group would have executives and a Katekita for the many occasions when the pirihi couldn't be there.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;>I can't forget the faithful Legion of Mary, 3 groups in Glen Innes, Senior, Intermediate and Junior; Panmure with its junior group; Papatoetoe and Otahuhu with a senior group each.  The Legion did a lot of work with our Maori people, and it did a lot of good for me too.</p>

<p class="caption">Fr. Laidler (with cross) also says good-bye to Fr Jack King.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">It's funny how you only remember the good times, and the good people one got to know in the travels about the city. Dave King and Margaret were so very kind to me. What a laugh, one day, when we persuaded Dave to come and watch a cricket match at Eden Park. New Zealand was playing West Indies. He only came to please us; I think he's still waiting for the kick-off! I hear that Dave's health is not good. You must all pray very hard to keep his because his guidance in things Maori is so valuable.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Another great friend and hard-case has gone to heaven; Charlie Shelford. At the time, Charlie and Blue were preparing to have their marriage blessed in the church and I had to take Charlie through the Catechism. Poor Charlie, after a day's hard work, theology was the last thing he wanted to discuss! But he was a great person when it came to the practical side of being a Christian. He and Turo Tepania were so faithful in visiting the sick in hospital. When Fr Cushlow's Mum was nearing the end, they used to pray with her every night, and the Sisters would broadcast their night prayers all over the ward. When she died they took her back to Waiaruke. Katahi a Charile ka tu ake ki te whai-korero - the very first time in his life. "This is the first time I've ever stood up, even among my own people, but I want you to know that I'm not scared of Ngati Kahu or their pirihi or his Mum!"</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">If I told all the stories about Charlie, there wouldn't be room left in your book.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">So I'll finish off by thanking you again for the very happy Jubilee. For the years that lie ahead, kia mau ki to koutou Whakapono me to koutou Maoritanga.</p>

<p>God bless you all,</p>
