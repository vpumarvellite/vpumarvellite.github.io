<h1>Final Day</h1>

<p><strong>SUNDAY 10th March</strong> was the final day of celebration.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock the visitors were being welcomed in the Foyer, until the arrival of our guest of honour, Pihopa Takuira and his Ope. He was the main Celebrant for our Wiha Whakawhetai. We have so much to be thankful for, not least the great week of reunion.</p>

<p>Then we were welcomed into the Hall where another great Feast had been prepared. Considering the number to be fed, the waitresses did a tremendous job. Maybe one shouldn't mention particular names, but we can't thank Mahu Makiri and Nina enough, for their quiet work over the pots and pans in the Kitchen.</p>

<p>While we ate we were entertained by Manutaki, Ngati Hine, Te Wairere o Tamaki, Te Puru o Tamaki, Pukekiwiriki, Te Umere o te Aroha - you would go a 100 miles for entertainment like that. (Hope we haven't missed out any group!)</p>

<p>Once more we crowded into the Chapel and overflowed into the Foyer for Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. Once more the Latin hymns just flowed, and the bells were rung at the right time! And the smell of incense pervaded the air. We felt so holy!</p>

<p>And if that wasn't enough, we crowded back into the Hall for the 53rd performance of <em>Christ the Maori</em>, presented by Rangimarie with help from Bub Wehi and Waka Huia.</p>

<p>At 10.30 we closed the Jubilee Week with Supper, closing speeches and the blowing out of the Jubilee Candle by Dame Whina. It will be kept in the chapel and lit on the final day of the Jubilee Year when we will have a Silver Debutantes Ball - with Ben Tawhiti providing the music.</p>

<p>Pihopa Takuira said the final prayer and gave us his blessing but we didn't want to go home! There was such a happy atmosphere. Hokianga whanau were the hosts that day - which means nearly everyone, as there are very few without some connection to Hokianga.</p>
