    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <h2>Before Te Unga Waka – Ko Te Hekenga Nui</h2>
    <p>Imagine Auckland in the nineteen thirties. "Clang, clang ... " goes the tram up and down Queen Street and off to the far away suburbs of Avondale and Epsom. Henderson is really in the wopwops. Over the harbour by ferryboat, it's a couple of miles walk to the little college of Hato Petera or St. Peter's Maori College, Northcote.</p>

    <h2>Dean Alink</h2>
    <p>Dean Alink is the Tumuaki and the aim of the college is to train Katekita to be spiritual leaders in their own communities. They study the basics plus Maori language, the Holy Scriptures and theology and some scientific agriculture. A visit to the city takes all day; and if you want to take the car across, it's a real hoha. There's very few Maori living in town. "Guess what" said the Dean to Pa Anehema, "I saw a Maori on the tram today."</p>

    <p>There's a few Cinemas, beautifully decorated like the Civic and a few Dance Halls and Theatre provide entertainment. Not every home has a radio. They're big, heavy things, called wirelesses. The daily papers or the Weekly Illustrated News keep people in touch with one another and the big world.</p>

    <h2>World War II</h2>
    <p>People keep hearing about a fellow called Herr Hitler. He was throwing his weight around in Europe, taking over the countries and making inflammatory speeches. Hitara Waha Huka - Hitler the frothy mouth, says the Maori haka about him, referring to his rantings and ravings. Then in September 1939 the War starts. Most of us can't get into the army quick enough. "Come on, let's join up!" "It might be over before we get a chance to see the world!"</p>

    <h2>Ko Te Hekenga Nui</h2>
    <p>With the War, the heavy industries start to pick up. Food supplies are needed "over there". The wharves are really humming. They need strong workers. "Get some of those strong bushmen to come to town." The same happens for the Power-lines, Telephones, Road, Railways. Word gets around that there are jobs. Remember this is after the dreary, hungry years of the depression. There's work too for the ladies. They make good wages in the light industries like pottery and lolly-making. They have to take over jobs that men used to do. There's a big need for cleaners and cooks; the trains are busy bringing families to the big city mainly from Northland.</p>

    <h2>The Big City</h2>
    <p>In the beginning it's the inner city for them, Greys Avenue, Wellington Street, Pitt Street, Cook Street, Grafton Lynn, Ponsonby. All became familiar names. Some families found good boarding houses and families formed lasting friendship, like the Shannahan, Waru and Hohepa families. But a lot of rental housing is rubbish! Peeling wallpaper, rotting wood-work, cracked pipes and drains.</p>

    <h2>Kei Hea Te Whare Karakia?</h2>
    <p>City life can be a lot of fun; but "Where is the marae"? "Where is the Church?" (Heard outside St Benedict's). "Hey is this a church? I thought it was a factory or something.") Many of our people went to St. Patrick's Cathedral for Sunday Mass. Then the Sisters who taught in St. Patrick's School in Wellington Street, offered the use of a classroom for Miha Maori. At week-ends Pa Werahiko (Father Frank Rice) came over from Petera to say Mass. Word got around and soon even the classrooms were not enough and the crowd spilt out into the passage and entrance.</p>
