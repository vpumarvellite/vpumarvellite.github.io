  <h1>Te Unga Waka Football &amp; Music</h1>

  <p>On Sundays, of course, there was the Mass at 11am, but there was a growing demand for sporting contacts and Field Days and After-Match Socials. This changed the focus and inevitably, we splintered into different groups, but the Whanau still grew.</p>

  <p>The Boys, not to be outdone, became quite a formidable force on the Rugby field. The Blue and Gold were  again to the fore with the support of GO WAKA. We played enough games to keep us busy. In 1968, for example,  we played 11. It was a mixture of young and old, but very spirited, with the likes of Toby Curtis at First Five and Willie Parker, and Morgan Puru at Centre.</p>

  <p>Morgan was the forerunner to Joe Stanley (who must have been studying our man)! He was much respected for his bone-crunching tackles. He was a smooth running Centre. Joe Whiu at fullback was as safe as a Church. The Hostel Boys from Dommet Ave, Dominion and Owens Roads, formed the bulk of our players. Often they had to miss the socials (Shame!) to get back to their hostels in time; otherwise it was a telling-off, or even getting locked out.</p>

  <h2>Te Unga Waka Football Team</h2>

  <pre>
Toia, Peter Tamepo, Pat Peita, Toi Rapira, Nick Adams, Jerry Clark, Maurice Toetoe, Manu Adams, John Williams, Pat Larkins, Toby Curtis, Percy Davis, Louis Brown, Bob Newson, Jim Sarich</pre>

  <p>Although we don't like to admit it, we've slowed down and have a tough job keeping up with our sons. Like the Mothers, we still try to prove something by joining the Golden Oldies.</p>

  <p>Kia ora to Bruce Wynyard, Wally Palmer, Peter Tamepo, Vaevae, Maurice Toetoe, Mike Jones, John Fisher and so many others. Of course, there was the main Power-house of the Forwards, with the likes of Pat Peita, tall, stalwart and tough in the mould of Andy Haden – Manu Adams, head banded like Buck Shelford – Calm Adams (Nick) always on the loose ball, and calming the stirrers in the pack who often picked fights, but left them to Manu and Mike Tipene to finish, like the ferrets Bobby Newson, Louis Brown and Percy “Boar” Davis.</p>

  <p>These three came to be a force to reckon with on the field – and off the field. There was an occasion in Pakanae, Whirinaki, where the Referee lost control, but with a difference. He blew the whistle as he saw the back end of Percy 
    in hot pursuit of the two so-called friends into the ti-tree, to belt them for calling him Boar on the field.</p>

  <h2>Music Making</h2>

  <p>Many bands became the favourite musicians of the time, and to this very day one of the Bands continues to play on. I refer, of course, to The Impacts, with the music of Taku Adams, Tori Adams, Teddy Adams and Tau Adams.</p>

  <p>There were also the Radars, the blind musicians, who were the Rave of the time. The Magakahia's, Lucia, Jackie and Family. There were the Cooks, Brian and Boxer and their Band, and, still going strong, is Ben Tawhiti and his Band. Chuck and Howard Morgan displayed the Classic Guitars. </p>

  <p>The Bradfields, with Millie singing, Linda and Mary followed in Mum's footsteps. Many a professional guitarist can take a bow to Johnny Bradfield, such a talented professional!</p>
