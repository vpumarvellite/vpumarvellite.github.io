<pre>
E te whanau ma, e toku iwi tena koutou katoa. 
Tuatahi o nga take he mihi ki nga mate. 
Tuarua o nga take he tangi ki nga mate kua eke mai ki runga i tenei marae. 
He mihi, he tangi e.  
E kui ma, e koroua ma, e nga morehu o te hunga kua katohia e te mate, tena ra koutou katoa. 
Kati tenei.

<p>Mr Stephen Leacock, a famous writer, once said: It is not hard to write. All you have to do is get some paper and a pen and then sit down and write what OCCURS to you. The writing is not hard, but the OCCURRING - this my friend is the difficulty.</p>

<p>The original Bakery, rebuilt into a Maori centre, converted from one kind of food house to another kind of food house is, thank God, still surviving and working most successfully for the Maori people.</p>

<p>All our priests, my dear people, who worked in the city and who were attached to Te Unga Waka Centre, worked very hard and were devoted and dedicated to the people and work that our missionary vocation demanded of us. I refrain from mentioning any names, because I know that I'll unwittingly omit to mention someone.</p>

<p>We know too that despite frustrations and disappointments in the course of the work, there has been very much happiness too. We know that because it is God's work, it will not break down but continue to prosper.</p>

<p>At one time there was an Englishman who was driving his Rolls Royce car through the Alps. Unfortunately, as he was making a turn at high speed, a front spring broke. In distress, our driver phoned the Rolls Royce Company in England to report the trouble and the next day, a company representative appeared and replaced the broken spring with a new one. So the Englishman and his Rolls purred on their merry way and without further mishap on the holiday. No account was received for the work or for the new spring, and this worried the Englishman. Finally, he sent a telegram asking for the account for "Swiss repairs of Rolls Royce broken spring". The manager of RR replied most courteously, "There's no such thing as a broken spring on a Rolls Royce."</p>

<p>May I conclude these congratulatory remarks with the following story. I feel the story can be applied to the pirihi o te taha Maori. We have never been under the illusion that we understood the Maori people as they understand themselves, and at times, this non-understanding has been the cause of our frustration and grief but it has never prevented us from loving the people and the work. Here is my story :-</p>

<p>Mr Harry Winston was known as the Ace of Diamonds and had a life-time love affair with the precious stones and this made him the world's leading gem dealer. His headquarters were a five storey building in the style of Louis XIV in 5th Avenue, New York. Harry once watched one of his salesmen show a beautiful diamond to a wealthy Dutch merchant. The customer listened thoughtfully to the expert's description, but eventually turned away, saying, "It's a wonderful stone, but not exactly what I want." Winston stopped the customer on his way out and asked "Do you mind if I show you that diamond once more?" The merchant agreed and Winston took the stone in his hand. He did not repeat anything the salesman had said. He simply talked about the gem as an object of deep beauty. Abruptly, the customer changed his mind and bought the diamond. While he was waiting for it to be brought to him, he turned to Winston and said, "Why did I buy it willingly from you, though I had no difficulty in saying no to the salesman?" Winston answered, "The salesman is one of the best in the business. He knows diamonds, but I love them".</p>

<p>God bless you all and the priests and nuns who work with you.</p>
