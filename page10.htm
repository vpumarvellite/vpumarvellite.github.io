    <h2>Renall Street</h2>
    <p>With many families looking for homes in the big City, it wasn't easy to get a house. Pa Tewano was lucky to get 4 Renall Street in Ponsonby. It had no phone and he never did get one put in. He got a car, but never "broke it in". It used to take charge of him, so most people were relieved to see him on his old push-bike. It must have been hard going, pushing up and down Cook and Wellington Streets and College Hill. "We used to look forward to Father's visits as kids," one of our people remembered. "He would turn up on his bicycle with a few lollies in his pocket.</p>

    <h2>Hall in Ponsonby</h2>
    <p>In 1949 another hall came up for sale. This time it was in Ponsonby. The terms were agreed and Archbishop Liston went along with the Dean and Pa Tewano to clinch the deal. (Knowing them they probably toasted it in orange juice!) Unfortunately, at this time, the city council was getting very uptight about residential and industrial areas. The hall was in a residential area. That was that! It could not be used as a Maori Centre. It was argued back and forth with the Council, but the rules were new and no one was going to bend them. Ironically the same old hall sees dozens of Samoan families coming for second-hand clothing sales every Saturday.</p>

    <h2>The Fifties</h2>
    <p>Suddenly we were into the nineteen fifties. There was full employment. England was taking all the food we could produce. The farmers were happy and the city was busy too. A lot of our young families made the decision to leave their country homes and work near the mills, freezing works, dairy factories etc and Auckland grew like a mushroom. Houses were needed and our boys were good at building. Reticulation of power and telephone lines was a "family affair". Mike Tipene remembers Uncle Dan Rapira reminding the young lads that the good names of their families were at stake and they had a proud record to keep up; no skiving off to the pub or the T.A.B. Buck Tipene and his family got special mention in the Power Boards bulletins. Ko wai ano? The Clarke-Morungas, the Noa, Peita, Korewha families were all valued workers.</p>

    <p>We still liked our country food, kai moana and puha. Many a family remembers going out on expeditions with their kuia to pick watercress and puha. Granny would organise the youngsters, each with a sugar bag, and off they went on the tram. The little snobs sat at the far end of the tram and pretended they didn't belong to kuia! What if her shoes did have holes in them! They were comfortable.</p>
