  <h1>LIVING CONDITIONS</h1>
  <h2>ENTERTAINMENT</h2>
  <p>
    There was no "square eye" looking at you in every house. In fact, at this time there was a lot of overcrowding. Dame Whina and her helpers were assaulting the ears of Government departments, especially the Maori Affairs, to know why it was so hard to get home-finances. In the end, she got results by going direct to the Minister of Maori Affairs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overcrowding caused our people to find their amusements outside the home. When the youngsters came home from school, they ran off to play. If the family was religious, they would have karakia in the evening. Sometimes they got slack and it took a visit from the Legion of Mary to revive family prayer, especially the Rosary.
  </p>
  <p>
    No one had heard of "Teen-age Culture" yet. Records were big 78s—no tapes or trannies or Walkmen. Popular diversions at weekends were dances and cinema. Quite a few of our people began to show their natural talent for music. They joined bands, played saxophones, steel and Hawaiian guitars, sang, and sometimes did a few items of Maori "culture".

  <h2>KEEPING UP THE FAITH</h2>
  <p>
    The first Catholic Maori families in Auckland made sure that their children got into Catholic schools and they supported each other in the Faith. Then Pa Tewano came to live in Ponsonby to look after the central city and the new suburbs to the west. Three years later, Pa Matiu began operating from Ellerslie, covering the new areas opening up to the south.
  </p>
  <p>
    Catechism Camps became popular. At first they went to Knock-na-gree in Titirangi and later in Hato Petera in the school holidays. Some of these were really big, with children staying a week and 30 or 40 making Communion.
