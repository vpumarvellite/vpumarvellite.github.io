<h1>MEMORIES OF TE UNGA WAKA</h1>

<pre>Te mea tuatahi maku, he wahi mihi ki a koutou katoa i tenei Tau Tiuperi o to tatou marae. 
Tena ra koutou katoa, nga hoa pumau, oku kuia, koroua, tuakana, teina tae noa ki nga wahi mokopuna, tena koutou, tena koutou, tena koutou.
Ko etahi kua ngaro atu i te kanohi, kaore e taea te powhiri-a-ingoa, otira me ki kua tae atu kotou ki te kainga tuturu, te marae o to tatou Ariki.
Haere, haere, haere.
Tena tatou te hunga ora e noho nei i tenei ao pahekeheke. 
Kua kaumatua haere tatou, kua ngaro nga huruhuru, kua piko nga tuara, otira, te mea nui e kaha ana tatou ki te katakata i a tatou e mahara nei ki nga wao mua.</p>

<p>During the years I spent at Te Unga Waka, it was often a hive of activity. Badminton was very popular, so was bowls. A lot of young people made sure the trampoline was in constant use. But there are some things that stand out clearer in the mind than others. I'll mention a few of these.</p>

<h2>OUR T.V. MIHA MAORI</h2>

<p>In October 1974 we were given the opportunity of presenting our Miha Maori on Television. After discussing it we decided to present it as a truly Maori event. Tikanga Maori of course lends itself to several elements of the Mass.</p>

<p>The welcome, the acknowledgement of each other and of our Kaihanga, the prayers of cleansing the soul when we confess our sinfulness, the seeking of wisdom from our spiritual tupuna, and many more.</p>

<p>For the first part of the Miha, we moved the altar and the chapel became a marae. The choir and the priests were the tangata whenua. The people were called in by a karanga, called and answered three times. Tauparapara "Ko te hakaariki, ko te Whakaariki ... ", "Toia mai te waka ... ". Then the first mihi aroha, with replies from the people, interwoven with our waiata, Tama Ngakau and E te Ariki tohungia ra matou.</p>

<p>By the time we got to the Offertory, the complete welcome had been carried out - ara, kua whakatau te iwi. The hosts and the guests had united as one family. The altar was then brought forward and the bread and wine placed on it. Then Dame Whina came forward and placed on the altar her C.B.E. which had just been added to her M.B.E. It was an act of thanksgiving and a plea for future guidance.</p>

<p>Afterwards, it was surprising how many Pakeha Catholics had watched and been moved by the aptness of so much of our karakia. For example the waiata powhiri after the Consecration expressed the basis of our Faith - that the Lord was really among us; and the No te Hohonutanga expressed our unity with those of us who had gone ki tua o te arai.</p>

<h2>FESTIVAL OF FAITH</h2>

<p>The Festival of Faith was another high point among our Whanau of Te Unga Waka. It took quite a lot of organising. Sunday after Sunday we had Bring and Buy and Raffles. Each group had our own Princess or Prince to support. The rivalry added the spice of competition and made the raising of money that much more enjoyable.</p>

<p>An exhibition of Religious Art was arranged, new hymns were composed and learned and Rangimarie "took a deep breath" and launched into the production of Christ the Maori.</p>

<p>The weekend Festival was held at Hato Petera. The kitchens at Te Unga Waka worked all day long and truckloads of food were carted over the shore to feed the multitude.</p>

<h2>TENTH JUBILEE</h2>

<p>The Tenth Anniversary of the opening also stands out in my memory. All the different branches of our Whanau and friends each took a different part of the marae to give it a "face-lift". The whole place from floor to ceiling was sanded, varnished, painted and draped in new curtains.</p>

<p>For the entertainment we went international. Each night of the week a different ethnic group came along with their own dances and music. It was very enjoyable seeing the immense variety of culture which is all around us in New Zealand.</p>

<h2>MARKET DAYS</h2>

<p>The Market days (usually Sundays) in Te Unga Waka hall helped to raise money for various projects. Victoria Market has nothing on what happened at Te Unga Waka - stalls everywhere, sales, raffles, weeks on end. One of the efforts that brought out the best in everyone was the family rivalry of the Princess and Prince Carnival. Our Kuia and Koroua had a great time helping their mokopunas. A huge number of entries made it one of the most close-fought carnivals and financially very successful.</p>
