  <h2>Aotearoa ki Alaska</h2>

  <p>
    Te Unga Waka and Te Rangimarie have provided
    stepping stones for young people to see the world. Here
    are a couple of extracts from a trip made in 1984 by
    some of our members. A party of sixteen travelled to
    Alaska as part of a cultural exchange. When practices
    started for this group there were about forty or fifty
    people eager to take part. But the costs were high, both
    in money and in the time involved. As the time drew near
    for departure, only sixteen were left, four of whom were
    from Rangimarie, Sarah and Tania Jacobs, Tony
    Rudolph and Robyn Nikora.

    We left Auckland on a wet, windy day; but there were
    heaps of friends, family and relations to give us a warm
    farewell. For many of us it was the first time on a plane
    and the thought of being 62,000 ft above ground wasn't
    very good for the digestive system.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had stopovers in Honolulu, Seattle and Tacoma,
    which helped us to relax a bit. Finally we arrived in
    Alaska stopping first at Juneau for a day and then
    coming to rest in Anchorage (translation = Te Unga
    Waka). We were boarded at the Alaska Pacific
    University.

    There we met our Eskimo guide called Ralph, and
    from there we met heaps of Eskimo and Alaskan Indians.
    The latter were surprised to see that we were very like
    them in looks. They had expected something totally
    different.

    The purpose of our visit was a cultural exchange, and
    boy, were our cultures exchanged! We did 3 or 4
    performances a day to different people and they were
    fascinated with our action songs, haka and poi and our
    kakahu Maori. We, in turn, were intrigued by their
    colourful dances.
  </p>

  <p>
    As soon as we met they started to fatten us up with
    what they call Potlatches, which would be the equivalent
    of our hakari. And did they have the works! Fresh salmon
    straight from the river, raw whale blubber, more salmon,
    caribou, moose, some more salmon, fermented sea
    blubber, salmon eggs, seal oil and more salmon
    (smoked, baked, broiled, raw, fritters, you name it).

    In Alaska there are five main groups of Alaskan Indian,
    related to the American Indian tribes. The Eskimo (Inuit)
    have three major groupings in the area we visited. The
    Indians are quite different physically to the Eskimo. The
    Eskimo are more closely related to Asian people
    especially from Mongolia, – short, thick-set and very
    strong. Whereas the Alaskan Indians are more like Maori;
    similar physique and skin colour.
