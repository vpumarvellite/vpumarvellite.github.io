    <h1>Outside St Patrick's Cathedral, after Pa Wiremu's First Mass</h1>

    <p>There weren't many Maori living in Auckland in 1944, but the Cathedral was packed. Many had made the special trip from the North and from Pa Wiremu's iwi from Taumarunui. Dean Alink and Pa Eruera (Fr Bruning) were his Deacon and Subdeacon. They were both over six foot tall and towered over him. But it was a very happy occasion, made especially so by his fellow students who came up from Napier and gave him a great welcome after the Mass. We used the Manchester Unity Hall for the celebrations. Once more the Auckland Maori were saying, "Wouldn't it be nice to have our own hall!"</p>

    <h2>Ngapuhi Welcome</h2>
    <p>The Marist Fathers gladly gave Wiremu the chance to visit the Maori parishes in the north. At first he was very shy. But as he went from one marae to the next, he grew in confidence and his Maori wairua began to come out more. One old Kuia said, "E Pa, this is what I've lived for, to receive Communion from a brown hand." After some fourteen years hard work on the Maori Mission in the Wellington Diocese, Pa Wiremu suffered a stroke-like illness which paralysed his speech. He gradually recovered from it and was able to return to his priestly work to some degree. He was a great source of spiritual help to the poets and thinkers who came to Hiruharama while he was there and they respected him highly. Recently he has returned with his sister Mrs June Mclntosh to the family papa kainga in Okahuhura near Taumarunui, for his retirement years.</p>

    <h2>Grey Lynn Hall</h2>
    <p>Not long after the ordination a big hall in Grey Lynn was put up for sale. The Dean made an offer which was accepted. But something made the seller change his mind at the last minute. Perhaps he was afraid because we were Maori or because we were Catholic – or a bit of both! There was a lot of religious bigotry and racism about at the time.</p>

    <h2>The War Ends</h2>
    <p>In May 1945 the war ended in Europe, but it took another four months and two atom bombs to finish off the Japanese resistance. But it was many months before the troops all came back. Four old boys of Hato Petera had been reported "missing in action believed killed". The Dean and all Hato Petera had a tangi for them and a Miha Tupapaku for the repose of their souls. But like all good Hato Petera boys, they turned up late, having been prisoners of war. John Taylor (Uncle Mac's youngest brother) was one of them.</p>

    <h2>Resident Missioner in Auckland</h2>
    <p>Pa Kereti Aarts had taken over the Sunday Mass in St Pat's school. Fr Rice had become ill and died in 1949, still only a young man. The Dean was looking for a pirihi Maori who could live in Auckland City and serve the people there. With the ending of the war, Pa Tewano could return to New Zealand. In 1934 he had gone to Mill Hill London to represent us at the St Joseph's Society Conference. He ended up being elected Superior General for all the Mill Hill Missions throughout the world. It is a difficult job at the best of times, but the
World War made it almost impossible. Many of his priests were imprisoned, some in the Philippines were killed and many churches and schools were destroyed. Pa Tewano began the work of rebuilding and then turned his steps back to Aotearoa, arriving in late 1947..</p>
