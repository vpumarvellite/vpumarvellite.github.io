  <h1>Variety Show</h1>

  <p>
    Then we were called into the Hall where Puti, Nina and Mahu and all their helpers had prepared a real banquet.
    As we ate, concert parties entertained us on the stage; Whai Ora, Pakipaki School and Te Ara Pounamu.
    The Cake for the Silver Jubilee was made up of 25 sections. Pa Henare and Piripi arranged for different VIPs and Old Friends to have the honour of cutting the cake.
  </p>

  <p>
    We kept to the time-honoured custom of calling every tribe and hapu and group to come forward and claim their cake with a song. It was great impromptu entertainments throughout the afternoon. And a very enjoyable evening.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the evening our Variety Show was started off by Lew Clauson. Lew was involved originally in the early days of fund raising. The Lew and Simon duo became quite famous, but always kept an interest in Te Unga Waka. He showed us that his talent is still there. Kia ora Lew!
