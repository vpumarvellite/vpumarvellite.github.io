<h1>THE RACE IS STILL ON</h1>

<p>Avondale racecourse has had to change its image over the years. It was not due to the horses but to the people. The same situation occurred between Te Unga Waka and Te Hauauru. There were, and still are, many good horses in either stable. They both knew their track and were qualified in running the course and drawing the scattered Maori of the Auckland district to their regular meetings.</p>

<p>The main stable, Te Unga Waka Centre, was accepted by most and given support.</p>

<p>Western suburbs (Te Hauauru) set up their own TAB (Housie) at Avondale and Te Atatu, using the Parish Halls. The dividends were shared out between the Parishes, Te Unga Waka and their own Committees. At that time there were already plans for a Catholic Marae at Te Hauauru. Under the guidance of the two Chief Whips (Stipes?) Eric Kidd and Sonny Johnson, they surely brought in the oats and worked very hard with their trainers and jockeys.</p>

<p>During my stay in Auckland (1972 - 1982), I looked after the Western suburbs for at least five years, and though there were some stray kicks for some, the overall running was excellent.</p>

<p>In my room is a picture of four horses, three mares and a black stallion, a true reminder of the Te Atatu Catholic Maori Committee - Sonny and Molly Johnson, Margaret Winks and Maggie, the only white horse on the team. What a great  team they were and they never seemed to get hoha.</p>

<p>May Gold bless them all and may Sonny prepare a good track for all of us on the heavenly racecourses.</p>

<p>At present the dream of Eric and his team has become a reality. They now have Te Whau. What was formerly the hall, and before that the church of St Mary's Avondale, is now their meeting-house.</p>

<p>Their funds, their energy and their artistry have made it a very special building. Best of all it has been honoured as a whare tangihanga, during the mourning for Dan Rapira. We are sure the Maori people of Te Hauauru will appreciate the work done by so many over the last 25 years.</p>

<p>Some have died since and others have retired to grazing in the superannuation paddock (where the grass is a bit thin these days)!</p>

<p>May the yearlings have the stamina of their parents and continue to do their trackwork. Each one will have a handicap, but that is the way of life. As long as we see them at the starting line! The Tupuna and the Auckland Maori Mission have put their bets on. Make sure the dividends are worth collecting in years to come!</p>

<p>Ma te Atua koutou katoa e manaaki, e tiaki hoki.</p>
