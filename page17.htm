    <h1>RANGIMARIE</h1>
    <p>
        After all the fund-raising and entertaining during the Queen Carnival, it was only natural that the supporters should keep on practising waiata and haka. They kept on meeting at the home of Miria and Wiki, now living at 48 Wellington Street. Soon the old house began to creak even more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because they came from different groups, the name Hui Mai was suggested. Others favoured Kotahitanga. But in the end, Rangimarie (Peace) reflected the feelings and desires of the whole group. This became the name, based on the saying of Jesus, "Ko te Rangimarie e hoatu nei e ahau ki a koutou, ko taku Rangimarie."

    <h2>LEADERSHIP AND TALENTS</h2>
    <p>
        Sonny Te Iri was chosen as Chairman, Pat Mendes as Secretary, Father Haring as Chaplain, and Eileen Kiwi as Treasurer. There wasn't much treasure in the terms of money, but there was plenty of treasure in the talents they possessed. Miria, with her lovely voice, happy presence, and leadership qualities, was a great asset. Johnny Tapiata, also of Ngati Ranginui, had a knack for producing new ideas and songs. Studying at Auckland University and always hungry, he naturally found his way to the table of his whanaunga, Miria. Together they hummed, strummed, and put new words to old tunes, reshaping them into beautiful action-songs.

    <h2>PREPARATION FOR THE ORDINATION</h2>
    <p>
        As the time came nearer for the ordination, more and more people joined the group. The year 1962 was the crunch year. Johnny came up with a very special song, "E Koro, Pa Henare e," capturing the spirit of the occasion in the words: "Mauria mai ra nga taonga a Ariki ... kia puawaitia te purapura o te kupu a te Atua." He went over to Hato Petera and also taught it to the boys—words and actions.

        Dame Whina had a big garage at her place in Cockburn Street, which she offered for their practices. She became their patroness; Totoni was patron, and his sister Maraea contributed with cookies. Dame Whina encouraged the young people to come together and put up a table tennis table for them. The group was made up of very normal people, not saints. There was plenty of raruraru, arguments, and differences of opinion. On many occasions, the Chaplain had to be the peacemaker. But having something definitive to aim at was a great boost to their spirits.

        By the beginning of 1962, it was definite that the Ordination would be in Auckland. Pa Teo had argued for Panguru, which would have had special meaning for the people of Tai Tokerau, but in the end, the weather and Archbishop Liston decided. June is definitely the muddy season in Hokianga, and sometimes even the machines didn’t get through owing to slips on the Skyline on Runaruna. Pa Teo graciously gave way and was invited to give the Kauwhau.
