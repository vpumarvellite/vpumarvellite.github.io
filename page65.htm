  <h1>Hotting Up</h1>

  <p>And the thoughts go back to those who made the evenings – John Keogh with his Puppet Dance, Edward Nlakiri and Pike Rapira (our answer to MC Hammer) and, of course, the smooth voice of "Nat King Cole", the late Butch Ruka.</p>

  <p>The spiritual life was in the guiding hand of Pa Henare. Retreats, invited Guest Speakers and many pep talks helped the taha wairua to grow. The whanau growth was the greatest where the weak were helped by the strong.</p>

  <h2>And So to the Sports Field</h2>

  <p>Netball was the highlight. Training sessions taken by Marrietta and Julie and Pa Henare and many other co-coaches enabled Te Unga Waka to field 6 Netball teams. And, of course, wherever the girls went, the boys followed. 
    We often wondered whether they followed the game or the girls. Whatever it was, Te Unga Waka had the greatest Supporters Club of all. "GO WAKA!" was the call heard at so many Netball courts.</p>

  <h2>The Champions</h2>

  <p>The teams performed to great heights, winning many championships at the Catholic Netball Courts and in many tournaments. The Blue and Gold colours were outstanding on the courts. The headlines in the sports pages of the old <i>8 O’CLOCK</i> papers were often "TE UNGA WAKA CHAMPIONS", "TE UNGA WAKA TOPPLES THE BEST", and many more.</p>

  <p>It is good to look back and then forward again, to those many young women who are now mothers, and the skills that you learnt and gave to Te Unga Waka. You can have the pleasure of watching your daughters take up the same challenges. Even if you can't keep up with them now, there's still the Golden Oldies Netball!</p>

  <p>There were a few trips to the Chinese Restaurant in Symonds Street to celebrate a win (only Take-Aways if we'd had a loss!) and then back to Te Unga Waka for a Social Evening or home.  "Flied lice on the menu! (Calm Adams)."</p>
