<h1>Auntie Martha</h1>

<h2>WAHINE RANGATIRA</h2>

<p>In August a couple of years ago, Lucy and Matt Hotere, Pa Ryan and a few others were keeping vigil beside the bed of Martha Cash. She had been admitted to hospital real with circulation problems and was going downhill.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she woke up. "Where am I? Am I still in hospital? Aue! I thought I was in heaven."</p>

<p>Martha had a simple faith in Jesus and his holy Mother. This life was just the waiting room for eternal life. That was why she was so disgusted to find herself still in the hospital room with her aching legs! However, she didn't have to wait long. Within a week she had gone to God.</p>

<p>The chapel at Te Unga Waka was packed with people; many Sisters of different religious Orders came to say good-bye, representatives of the Catholic Women's League came and 25 Mill Hill Fathers. Her family and friends took her back to Waihapa, the family home.</p>

<p class="maori-greeting">Haere ra e kui. Haere ki te kainga i ngakaunuitia ai hei nohoanga mou. Haere ki te whanau tapu, ki tou Whaea a Hata Maria, a, ki ou kuia koroua, karangatanga maha. Haere, haere, haere.</p>

<p>Martha was special. One couldn't help being uplifted by her presence. She had absolutely no artificial side to her character. If you tried to be crafty or devious, Martha would see through you in a flash - and, best of all, she would make you laugh at yourself and see the shallowness of your clever schemes.</p>

<p>Her straightforward style endeared her to the groups she joined. The Catholic Women's League were reluctant to have a special Maori unit at Te Unga Waka. But when they heard Martha relating her deep spirituality to her taha Maori, they realised that this special charisma blossomed best in a Maori setting.</p>

<p>Not many people knew that Martha had been a Nun for over ten years. She was a founding member of the Maori Religious Sisters started in 1935. They were a branch of the Marist Sisters who were teaching in the school in Waitaruke at that time. Eventually it was hoped that enough girls would join so that they could be independent and have their own Leadership and Formation Team.</p>

<p>Martha joined at the same time as Sister Dorothy (Kare Petera). There were five in that first group. They trained as teachers as well as learning to be Nuns.</p>

<p>The strict timetable was something they weren't used to; rising before dawn to recite the Office and meditate; having meals exactly on time every day and in silence while someone read from a holy book. Everything was regulated; the way you walked, the way you talked, the way you wore the habit. From Night Prayers to Breakfast the next morning was the Grand Silence when you talked only to God. Martha's family was very strong in their belief of Christ. Her brother Tom I, also known as Noema, was a leading Katekita. Her parents were Waironga and Mei.</p>

<p>Martha enjoyed the spiritual aspects of the life, but questioned some of the human values which seemed to be excluded. This came to a head when her mother died. The tangi was in the meeting house, just a couple of minutes walk from their house on the hill. But the rules of the Sisters would not allow her to attend. She would be able to go to the funeral, accompanied by two other Nuns. While this might have made sense in the day when the rules were first formulated, in 19th century France, it went against all Martha's Maori values. So there and then she told the Mother Superior that she would have to finish. She confided in friend Kare, who said to her that she had done very well in giving it a good try for over ten years. So Martha packed up her few possessions and went home.</p>
