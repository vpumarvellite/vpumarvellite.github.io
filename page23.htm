  <h1>Prince/Princess Carnival</h1>

  <div class="narrative">
    <p>Why limit it to the girls? Why not have a Prince/Princess Carnival?  By this time it is well recognised that "whanau-power" will get people going, more than anything else. So this time there were fifty family groups taking part. You have to admire the supporters. They had other projects going on, to support marae, schools and parishes back home in the country districts. Pat Mendes, for example, and Ngai Tupoto were saving up for the new marae at Motukaraka and they also put on a Queen Carnival for that. It was certainly a time for unselfish action.</p>

    <p>The winner this time was Haupuru, mokopuna of Auntie Puti, son of Weka and Edward. The Vicar General did the honours this time, Monsignor Cahill looked splendid in his robes. The effort raised another £7,500.</p>

    <h2>PASTORAL WORK</h2>

    <p>In case you think that all other work stopped to make way for fund-raising, here are a couple of extracts from <em>Te Waka o Hato Petera</em> for October 1964. (This was a monthly magazine published by the Mill Hill Fathers about Maori-Hahi activities; price 1/6d = 15c.)</p>

    <p>A Catechism camp for Maori children from the city and suburbs was held at Knock-na-Gree, from August 29 to September 4. It is an ideal spot for such camps. Situated on the outskirts of Glen Eden, in a bushy, secluded area, it soon makes one forget the busy, noisy city ... There is a little convent for the Marist Sisters who come for the week; and a one-room bach, known for some reason at the Vatican, in which the priest stays. Last, but not least, there is the dining room and kitchen under the supervision of Mrs Hayden and five girls from Mt Albert Marist School.</p>

    <p>On Thursday and Friday, 23 of the 50 children received the Sacraments for the first time: Reconciliation and Holy Communion, and a girl aged 12 was baptised.</p>

    <p>(The same report goes on to speak of Legion of Mary activities and the Ladies' Retreat at the Cenacle. But, of course, fund-raising had to be mentioned:) ... "Among the many activities going on to raise funds for the new Maori Centre are: - Housie-housie session held twice a week, on Thursday nights at the Catholic Hall, Ellerslie, and on Friday afternoons from 12 to 3 pm in the Labour Party rooms, opposite the C.P.O. in Queen Street; and weekly dances in Glen Innes."</p>

    <p>The Auckland Catholic Maori Cultural Group, "Te Rangimarie", continues its concerts around the city. To mention but three, concerts have been given to spastics and the children of the Kelston School for the Deaf & Dumb and the Old Folks. All concerts have been highly successful. They are now planning a concert to be given in Whangarei, where a big bazaar, sponsored by the local Catholic Maori, is to be held to help raise funds for the new Catholic Maori Centre in Auckland.</p>

    <h2>OLD BAKERY IN EPSOM</h2>

    <p>During 1962 and 1963 three possible buildings were looked at, but they were either too cramped, too expensive or in an awkward place for parking and access. Then towards the end of 1964 the old Gold Krust Bakery was offered for sale. It had been damaged by fire and looked a real mess. The girders looked rusty and shaky. But there was plenty of room to build a hall and other areas that could be renovated. The Committee looked it over a few times and compared it with other sites and possibilities.</p>
