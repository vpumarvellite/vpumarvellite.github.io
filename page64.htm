    <p>The Youth Club filled Te Unga Waka with life – youthful life that made it a great place to be for the weekends.  A solid foundation was set by the Committee of young leaders, steered by Pa Henare. Leaders such as the late Gerry Clarke, Weka Makiri (Mason), and Marrietta Kapeli, to mention a few, carried the Club to many sporting and social events throughout Auckland, and visits to other towns and cities.
    </p>

    <p>The Youth Club had its constitution with definite goals and objectives. It worked in well with the Executive Committee of Te Unga Waka, who supported it very well.

    <p>Talent Quests were a lively activity. There were many future stars who began treading the boards at Te Unga Waka – Erana Clarke, the Yandall Sisters, the Kake Sisters, and the late Butch Ruka.  But the unsung stars were those who often made up the dwindling line-up in the early heats.  They were entered for a bet, maybe by their mate, or had no money, and a prize, even a little one, would get them a bus ticket home! 
    </p>

    <p>There was also the wishful thinker, the trier who entered, never won the money and ended up walking home.  It's a long way from Epsom to Titirangi New Lynn, but we made it (I’m not mentioning those who lived in New Lynn or Titirangi!).
