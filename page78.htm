<h1>Te Korero a Pa Henare</h1>

<p>(Interview with Pa Henare)</p>
<p>(The success of our Silver Jubilee owed much to Pa Henare. His guidance and influence could be seen in all the events of the week's rejoicing, spiritual, cultural, praying and entertaining. His enthusiasm and energy were infectious.</p>
<p class="maori-greeting">No reira e tika ana kia mihi atu tatou ki a ia mo tana whakapau kaha mo tatou i tenei wa.</p>
<p>So instead of giving him more work to do writing an article for this magazine, we just sat down with the tape-recorder and taped a little conversation about the future of Te Unga Waka.</p>

<p>PA HENARE: There'll always be a need for Te Unga Waka, because we will always need he waahi huihuinga mo te whanau me te hapuu. Individual families can gather themselves together for their own purposes, but they will always need to reach out to the wider hapuu.</p>
<p>They cannot cope with functions of the hapuu in their own homes. The mana which comes from hapuu has to be seen and exercised on the marae - like Te Unga Waka and other marae.</p>
<p>Hence on a whanau basis, Te Unga Waka is needed, because an individual whanau is not self-sufficient. They need to reach out to hapuu and even to iwi, at times. It has to be so, because if we don't, we are failing to acknowledge the common tupuna of the whole people and are cutting ourselves off. If we cut ourselves off from iwi, we lose the strength of the iwi, and there are times when that strength is needed.</p>

<p class="caption">E teka ana Koe, Joe!</p>

<p>I see Te Unga Waka as being that gathering place but I also see the challenge to our whanau to make Te Unga Waka theirs - not just to use, as you might hire a public hall - but to own as part of themselves. There has to be a commitment of the hapuu to the place where they gather, otherwise they might as well be tauiwi.</p>
<p>The challenge for those elected to run Te Unga Waka (and that should be all the whanau), is to make it a real resource place for the people; to provide and store information, and to have the mana to call people mo nga take e pa ana ki a ratou. In this way it will be what it was meant to be. The essential element is that commitment.</p>
<p>If it is not there, kahore tatou e pono ana - and if we are not pono, then there will be no tika either. And if we don't have tika and pono there will be no aroha and we won't survive.</p>
<p>Te Unga Waka must be supported by the people and Te Unga Waka must serve the people.</p>
