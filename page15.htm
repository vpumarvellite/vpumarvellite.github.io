    <h1>FUNDRAISING</h1>
    <p>
        Although it was still a couple of years away from Pa Henare's ordination, some families in Panmure and Glen Innes decided to start a fund for this important kaupapa. It started in a small way among the families—the Daniels, Wihone, Shelford, Topia, Te Tai, King, Wharewaka me etahi atu. Tarau and Kaho and Maisie loved their cards and they were not the only ones. Dame Whina, Manuka Henare (kaumatua), Henare Noa, Mrs. Hughes (the jockey's mum), Koherangi and the Witanas all enjoyed a bit of a gamble. What better excuse could you have than the kaupapa of ordaining a priest?
    </p>
    <p>
        They knew that Auckland would have to accommodate and feed the crowds. There was not much doubt it would be in Auckland, although they knew that Pa Teo in Panguru would be fighting for it to be held there. After a time when the money had grown, it was suggested to Bishop Liston that if there was some left over, it should form the nucleus of a fund to help more Maori boys to study for the priesthood. The Archbishop felt criticised: "I will look after any boy who wants to go to the Seminary, whether he is Maori or Pakeha," he said. "Mmm… better put it towards a Maori Catholic Centre."
    </p>
    <p>
        Other areas began to join in the fundraising. Pa Kereti Haring had now joined the team and he jokingly referred to himself as Auntie Whina's taxi. "E Pa, what are you doing? I want you to drop everything and come and take me to Te Atatu ... to North Shore ... ki ko ... ki ko." Housie had been legalised and games sprang up all over the place. Dame Whina stirred them up. "E Whina, how come you know so many people?" asked Pa. "E Pa, these are all my bones!"

    <h2>QUEEN CARNIVAL</h2>
    <p>
        Why not unify these fund-raising activities by having a Queen Carnival? Dame Whina had already been involved in these for other projects. In fact, Sir John Allum, then Mayor of Auckland, had once said that Whina taught him a lesson in fund-raising.
    </p>
    <p>
        Seven groups formed:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>City 1, City 2, City 3</li>
        <li>Glen Innes-Panmure</li>
        <li>Western Suburbs</li>
        <li>Manurewa-Clevedon</li>
        <li>South Auckland</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Each chose a pretty girl for their Queen. The target was 300 votes for each Queen (1 vote = £1). There were dances, basket-socials, hangis, bring and buys, raffles, card evenings—anything that would make money.
    </p>

    <p>
        Those first Queens still remember those days. They had to work hard too, no queenly privileges for them. They were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Martha Karanga</li>
        <li>Cecilia Lundon</li>
        <li>Ngawini McMath</li>
        <li>Maria Matthews</li>
        <li>Barbara Mackie</li>
        <li>Sarah Lundon</li>
        <li>Dorothy Wihone</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It was a ten-week campaign, ending at midnight of 10th October. The Port Building Hall was the venue. All through the evening, money was handed in. Rumours went back and forth. But Ngeungeu Zister was a shrewd operator. She kept her group just ahead of the opposition. People were turning out their pockets to see if they could squeeze out a few more "votes" for their Queen. But just before midnight, Ngeungeu slipped in the last of her "votes". Pa Matiu rose amid a hushed silence and read the total for each Queen. The Manurewa-Clevedon group had made £976.10.3d.
