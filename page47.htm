<h1>CHRIST THE MAORI</h1>

<p>By Manu Adams</p>

<pre>Haere mai nui mai, e te Ariki
Ko koe te Aranga me te Ora
Mauria mai nga taonga wairua
Nga hua tapu o te Aranga
Kia hari kia koa tatou katou
Na te mea kua ara a Hehu
Kua ara tatou i roto i te Ariki
Kua whiti ki te maramatanga
Areruia, areruia, areruia</p>

<pre>Tenei te mihi atu nei ki a koutou te Komiti Whakahaere o te Tiuperi, ki nga kaimahi hoki me nga ringa wera, araa, koutou katoa, Kuia, Kaumatua, Taitamariki Tamariki tae noa ki te Whakatuputanga Hou. 
Tena koutou katoa. He nui nga mihi ki a koutou mo te pai o te Wiki Tiuperi o Te Unga Waka.</p>

<p>I would like to extend my congratulations to all concerned in the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of Te Unga Waka. Personally I was very sad that I was called away on Social Welfare business and was able to enjoy only a couple of days of the Jubilee.</p>

<p>Memories come flooding back to my mind as I think of the years when I was Chairperson of Te Rangimarie Cultural Group. For more than five years we took the play, Christ the Maori to so many halls and Marae all over the country.</p>

<p>In 1973 Te Rangimarie began practising for the Festival of Faith, to be held that October in Hato Petera. As many of the items touched on the life of Christ, Pa Henare suggested that we weld them together and create new ones. So we began to use waiata, petere, poi and haka to illustrate Christ's life, death and resurrection.</p>

<p>KARAITI TE MAORI made a strong impression at the Festival. There was something different, something charismatic about it. We thought it would only be a "one-off" performance, but immediately requests started coming in for repeat performances, Parish priests wanted it performed in their parishes, leaders from other areas wanted it presented on their marae. From then on we were kept busy, complying with the invitations which came from everywhere.</p>

<p>During that time I had the chance to observe the concepts of Whanau and Whanaungatanga at work in our group. There were pressures and stresses and grievances, but they were outweighed by the whanaunga unity. We were dedicated and committed to portray a drama that was steeped in Taha Wairua and Taha Maori.</p>

<p>The group usually consisted of fifty or sixty as well as the little ones. An invitation would be received either personally or it writing. The Chairman, the Spiritual Director and selected members of the group would make the decision to accept or decline. The group members were ordinary working people so we had to watch the expenses, especially the means of travel. But in those five years, I cannot think of an invitation being declined.</p>
