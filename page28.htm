<h1>Miria and Wiki</h1>

<p>Wiki continued the work of the Legion of Mary with meetings at their home in Astley Avenue. He still travelled to meetings as Chairman of the Maori Pastoral Diocesan Council, facing up to several important issues. Over and over he stressed that the Maori people must take responsibility for their own spiritual needs.</p>

<p>At this time the whole Catholic Church was busy getting people to understand that lay people have a crucial role in the life of Faith. Less candidates were coming forward to be priests, and the Mill Hill Fathers were not able to keep up their numbers. This was a blessing in disguise. As long as there were plenty of priests, with Nuns and Brothers to teach, the people were content to leave everything to them - spiritual welfare, education, rites and rituals, prayer, biblical studies and sometimes even political and social issues.</p>

<p>While trying to persuade the people to be more independent in their minds, Wiki feels that he may have overstepped the bounds of tapu and that this may be the cause of the semi-paralysis from which he suffers. Perhaps there were too many conflicting areas which Wiki tried to reconcile in his own person. He certainly didn't consider his own health as he went around like a modern-day Saint Paul, staying weeks in some parishes to explain the message.</p>

<p>If one reads the minutes of the Pastoral Council in those years, both Regional and National, one sees a wide variety of topics: Community Priests, education in general, education in Maoritanga, the meaning of a Vocation, relationship with Parishes and the Hierarchy, Katekita/Kaiarahi, politics and the right of protest. One of the biggest problems was to persuade people to actually study the situation. Why should they bother? Weren't the delegates elected to do that?</p>

<p>In 1977 Wiki stepped down from the Chairmanship of the Diocesan Maori Pastoral Council. Younger leaders were coming forward with their own ideas. But Bishop Mackey asked Wiki to accept the honorary title of President of the Council. He could thus feel part of the work while handing over the heavier burden to Harry Semmens.</p>
