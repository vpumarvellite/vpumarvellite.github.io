<h1>Greetings from St. Anne's, Manurewa</h1>

<p>It was a very happy occasion to meet lots of old friends on March 5th at Te Unga Waka. But at the same time there was an element of sadness, because so many faces were missing, - all those lovely people who had been so much a part of the history of Te Unga Waka, but who have now gone to their reward.</p>

<p>Our family became connected with the Maori community around Manurewa. We were newcomers in a strange land and so were the Maori people because the city and suburbs were frightening places to them, compared with their quiet country settlements. We were very friendly with Joe and Bella Harris, Joe and Nani Te Awhitu, Joe Korewha and his wife, Eileen, Bella's sister, Gran and husband Steve Paparoa and quite a few others.</p>

<p>It was fun working with people who had a purpose in life - to build a Maori Centre. We had Queen Carnivals and a Concert with Kiri Te Kanawa who had just won the Mobil Sun Quest. We sold far more tickets than the regulations allowed for our parish hall! But what a night it was!</p>

<p>Our efforts weren't always successful though. Someone on the Committee had a bright idea to have a fund-raising Gala Dinner. We would do it like the American Election Campaigners - so much a plate. £10 was decided on. That was an awful lot of money in those days. Letters went out to "rich" people and the business community. The letters looked beautiful. They even had Bishop Liston's letterhead, no less! Most did not even reply, we received a couple of £10 donations. It was a grandiose flop! Half the Committee couldn't even afford to go. The only one who benefited from this venture was Bella Harris. She'd had her teeth removed a while before this, and, so far, hadn't saved enough for the dentures. We couldn't allow one of our leaders to go along to a posh "do" without teeth, so we have a "whip-around" and came up with enough for Bella to get her full set. At the next meeting we were all sitting round looking miserable about the sad outcome of our efforts, but one person was able to show a toothy grin! In the end, she made us all cheer up.</p>

<p>Although Kees, my husband and I did not care much for Housie, we helped organise the Housie evenings in our parish hall on the basis of 50% to St Anne's and 50% to Te Unga Waka. Quite an eye-opener for us, with some people playing four or five cards per game all evening.</p>

<p>An offshoot of these activities was the formation of Te Ropu o Hata Ani, the Maori Club of St Anne's School, Manurewa. It started in 1970 with between 40 and 50 members. Mrs Kathleen Waru was leader and Mr Bill Carter was President - both now deceased. As St Anne's did not have that many Maori pupils, most group members were Pakeha, who threw themselves with great gusto into haka and action songs, and the girls became quite expert with the poi. We mothers made the costumes from real flax piupiu (no drinking straw ones for our club!) to diligently worked tipare headbands, sashes and bodices. The group took part in competitions in Te Unga Waka - a great way for parents and children of different races to mix and learn together. The children also performed for the elderly folk in Greenlane and Middlemore Hospitals. It was good while it lasted.</p>

<p>So thank you very much for the invitation to the recent festivities. It was lovely to see old friends. It was good to see that the spirit of Te Unga Waka is still alive and well. May it continue to support each new generation as it comes along.</p>
