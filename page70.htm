    Tena ra koutou katoa, e te iwi o Te Unga Waka. He mihi whanui tenei ki a koutou katoa, 
    E kui ma, e koro ma, e te Rangatahi tae noa ki nga mokopuna. Tena koutou i te wa hari nei o to koutou, 
    me ki pea, o tatou marae o Te Unga Waka. Tena koutou katoa, huri noa, huri noa, oku whanaunga i roto i te Whanau o Hehu Karaiti. 
    Tena koutou.
  </p>

    I was at Te Unga Waka during 1976 and 1977, and still rather loosely 1978/9 while based at Mangere East parish. 
    I came there first as a Deacon, to broaden my knowledge of pastoral work, but what I found was a family which adopted me as one of their own boys. 
    When I was ordained in April 1976, Wiki led a big group to Remuera where the Ordination took place, Rangimarie was there and friends from Mangere. 
    And afterwards the first speech I made as a Priest was in Maori. I must have been "maia" in those days!
  </p>

  <p>
    I felt Te Unga Waka, with Maori family and Mill Hills, was a marvellous place in which to begin living as a priest. 
    It was always a warm, lively and happy set-up. While other priests with whom I was ordained were doing "ordinary" parish things, 
    I was tripping around the country with Rangimarie and "Christ The Maori"; it was great fun!
  </p>

  <p>
    While at Te Unga Waka I was always connected with Mangere. It was a bit of a standing joke that I belonged to Ngati Mangere (The Lazy Tribe). 
    And I have many fond memories of "Mangere Catholic Maori Society". We had some lovely times together. 
    They say that a priest leaves his heart in his first parish and his books in the second. It's true !!

    When I think now of Te Unga Waka, my mind turns to many who have passed on ... probably most notably Sister Marie Chanel, 
    but so many others such as Charlie Shelford, Martha Cash, Jack Russel, Pa Teo, Pa Matiu, Julie Adams ... etc, etc. 
    E moe koutou. E moe i roto i to tatou Ariki. Tena, kei te haere mai te wa ka tutaki ano tatou i a tatou, 
    te wa hakari nui i te marae o to tatou Ariki me tona Whaea. E moe, e moe, e moe.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was always touched by the aroha shown to me, as a young priest, and a pirihi Pakeha at that! 
    May I extend my greetings to all involved with the present Jubilee Year and wish you every blessing, 
    and my prayer is that Te Unga Waka will continue to be te unga rangimarie mo nga waka katoa o te motu.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tena koutou, tena koutou, tena tatou katoa.
