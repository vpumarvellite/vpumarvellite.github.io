      As an adjunct to the Social Services we have the Roopu Tautoko Rangatahi.
      This comes into operation during school holidays. It organises holiday events
      and programmes for the Rangatahi. The contact person here is Miria Te Hau.

      Across the courtyard is the <strong>KOHANGA REO</strong>, with its white fence
      and children's play-area. There Betty Campbell, joined recently by Sister Edith Peita,
      is looking after our mokopuna. There they have all the normal pre-school activities,
      but with a background of Maori language all around them.
      (As one former Kaiako said, <em>"All my babies laugh and cry in Maori!"</em>)
      The Manager of this operation is Miria Te Hau.

      Next door is the <strong>MAORI ACCESS OFFICE</strong> and lecture room,
      with the desks and computers and other different helps for people
      who are learning new skills. The modules help the trainees to realise their own skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are taught how to apply for a job with confidence, how to manage a key-board,
      how to feel good with their own culture and spirituality.
      This year’s tutor Erana Poulson comes from Ngati Hine and Ngapuhi.
      Urania administers the operation among her other jobs.
      This is the fourth year that Te Unga Waka has been operating a Maori Access scheme,
      with a great deal of success.
