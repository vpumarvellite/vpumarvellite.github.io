<p>I have been asked to open up the book of memories and one of the first things that comes to mind concerns our play, <em>Christ The Maori</em>. When Pa Henare was composing the play, relating Scripture with tikanga Maori, he looked around for people to fill the roles. Pio and I were not particularly active at the time, but our children were in the Rangimarie where it all started. Pa Henare began to feel that Pio should fill the role of Christ with myself playing the role of our Lady. He came out to see us and put it to us. We talked about it, then we talked about it some more, and we thought, Taihoa! This is a special thing, because of both the Biblical side and the taha Maori. What would our people say with regard to aspects like the tangihanga for Christ which would take place on the stage. Maori did not believe that you could portray a dead person with a living one. We were also surprised that Pa had come to ask us to portray such holy people. It was an honour, but also a concern. I know Pio looked at himself and wondered if he should take on that tapu role of Christ.</p>

<p>Pa asked us to consider it for a week. Now that seems a long time, but then it seemed no time at all and we had to make a decision. We had to nut things out; for instance how would it affect our children who were only little at the time. In the end we made the decision; if we really believed in Christ, what are we afraid about?</p>

<p>It was only to be a one night performance, but it ended seven years later after 52 performances, 53 now with the latest performance at the Jubilee. The first performance was at the Festival of Faith at Hato Petera College. A lot of people came to it. Some, especially our own relatives, came along because they were nosey and expected to see Pio die on stage. If you tangi for a live person, they said, it was a bad omen. The area was very touchy for us, because we too grew up with those ideas. Anyway, it all went off so successfully that people followed us around to every performance for years.</p>

<p>We had some great times, taking it from Kaitaia to the Bluff. It gave us the opportunity to experience the protocol of different tribes. I remember sitting on one marae in the early morning, with ice about two inches thick. And nobody really complained because it was part of protocol. We did our penance on these occasions.</p>
