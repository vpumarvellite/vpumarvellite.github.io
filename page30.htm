<h1>KI TA TE WAHINE TITIRO</h1>

<p>E te whanau Maori e noho nei ki Akarana, tena koutou katoa. Ko te reo wahine tenei e mihi atu nei ki a koutou katoa i tenei tau tiuperi. He wa whai tikanga tenei, te huringa tau, rua tekau ma rima, o te whakapuaretanga o Te Unga Waka. No reira, tena koutou, tena koutou, tena koutou katoa.</p>

<p>I welcome this opportunity to speak to our people from a woman's point of view. As our whakatauki says: <em>He putiputi kei a ia ano tona kakara</em> (Each flower has its own fragrance). Or, in that other well known saying: <em>Ko tou rourou, ko taku rourou, ka ora te manuhiri</em> (With your basket and my basket the guest will be satisfied).</p>

<p>Our elders and our pirihi have said many times that Te Unga Waka owes much to the efforts of the women. In the Maori world and also in the Pakeha world, men are getting used to the idea that the women can have a leadership role every bit as powerful as that of the men. Some men need a fright to shake them up, or wake them up, but we are making progress. On this occasion I would like to think of our influence at Te Unga Waka as being "Mother's influence". Men relate more easily to their mothers! From their earliest years they have depended on mother's voice, her commands and decisions, so they find it easier to be told what to do by a motherly figure instead of by an awe-inspiring female.</p>

<p>My first mihi goes to the "powerhouse" of Te Unga Waka, to those unsung heroes and heroines who prepare and cook and serve and wash up and do all the jobs to feed the crowds. This was wonderful to see during the Jubilee week. Each whanau took a day to be hosts and caterers. I mihi to all those who have been the backbone of Te Unga Waka over the years.</p>

<p>Ko etahi o ratou kua ngaro atu i te kanohi tangata. Tears come to the eyes when one thinks of the lovely, helpful people who toiled in the kitchen, but have now gone to our real home. Haere atu ra koutou ki te Huinga o te Kahurangi. Haere atu ki te kainga tuturu. Kahore o reira hiakai, kahore he roimata, kahore he mamae. Nohoia te rangatiratanga o te rangi i whakaritea mo koutou. Haere, haere, haere.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can begin with the establishment of the Maori Women's Welfare League at Te Unga Waka. The date was 17th December 1967. Ka Corbett was President, Dame Whina was Patron, Tatiana Thompson was Secretary, Maria Parker was Treasurer. Others present were Frances Cook, Api Toia, Raiha Tipene, Barbara Wilson, Eve Te Tana, Liza Harema, Winnie Te Tai and myself.</p>

<p>Our first efforts were very "down to earth". We began with a "cooking day" at the Youth Hostel in England St, Ponsonby. We were dedicated to improving the health and welfare of the Maori. Our work in the first year was mainly helping sisters like Betty Wark, cleaning her Boys Hostel in Wellington Street, welcoming groups of Maori girls on their first visit to the City, and in general working in quiet ways to support our people.</p>
