<p>I would like to join you in the spirit of happiness at this time. For many years Te Unga Waka was my home. Like any home, we had our good times and bad, times where feelings got hurt and other times the loyalty of so many helped us forget the difficult times. I would like to thank those who have grown in stature and leadership qualities over the years. They help to make the work a lot easier to overlook the shadows and forget the tears.</p>

<p>So many families have benefited spiritually, materially and from the moral support given by Te Unga Waka and from all the operations which were based there. I would like to wish you all many more years of happy progress.</p>

<p>One incident comes back to mind which might have some application now. One evening at Rangimarie practice, news came that John McKay of Hillsborough had died. We all decided to go as a group to the Requiem Mass. But on the day of the funeral Molly Houpapa picked up the phone in the Credit Union Office and heard John's voice, talking to her and asking for a loan. She was absolutely stunned, and it took a while to convince her that he wasn't talking from heaven! (The mix up was caused by someone of the same name dying in that parish.)</p>

<p>So don't let anyone write off Te Unga Waka. It's still got a lot of life left in it yet.</p>

<p>No reira, kia kaha, kia maia, kia manawanui.</p>
