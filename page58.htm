<h1>Piripi's eagle-eye</h1>

<p>Piripi Munro came along to check on progress. His eagle eye didn't miss a thing. The smoke stains on the ceiling would have to come off! And here is a koha to help!</p>

<p>The women took over then and it was all Go Waka Go! Three nights before D Day; no sleep; decorate the Hall; Twist paper; make flower boxes; whakapati pot plants. Stop! Re-think! Mop floors! Redecorate the stage. Mop floors again! Put up curtains. Hope it doesn't rain - there are leaks at the back of the Hall. Different groups agreed to host a day each, feeding and entertaining.</p>

<p>Saturday belonged to Hato Petera. The PTFA and the Old Boys were Hosts for the day. But first of all they had to run their Annual Gala Day at the College. The sunshine and the crowds were just what the doctor ordered. The boys and their elders worked hard all day - not just buying and selling but also entertaining. Somehow in the evening they still had energy left for the Gala Social which was taken to Te Unga Waka. The younger students had their Blue Light Disco at the College.</p>

<p>Sunday began with a welcome to the travellers who had come overnight. Then the usual Sunday Miha Maori at 11 o'clock was taken over by the girls of Hato Hohepa. They prepared everything and led the singing assisted by St John's College, Hastings. The Hato Hohepa Old Girls and PTFA were the hosts for the day. They cooked all the meals and entertained us while we ate. After tea, we crowded into the chapel for Benediction.</p>

    <p class="caption"><p>Eugene and Dick Harris were the "altar boys" assisting the priests. Piripi made sure that we all appreciated the occasion. The singing was beautiful - O Salutaris, Tantum Ergo, Adoremus - we hadn't forgotten the tunes! We all remembered Sunday afternoons in country churches like Motukaraka, Waitaruke, Waihou, Rotokakahi, the sound of the chiming bells and the smell of incense.</p>
