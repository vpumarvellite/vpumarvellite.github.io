<h1>The Future</h1>

<p>Our work has a strong spiritual kaupapa which gives us a different approach from that of the Maori Women's Welfare League. But we are not afraid to go public on women's issues; women made in God's image, and on health and education issues. However, we value very highly the prayerful support we can give to our people in times of sorrow. Every year, when it gets towards Christmas time, we have our Thanksgiving Mass at the Carmelites. We always look forward to that haven of peace and the little party afterwards.</p>

<p>Looking at the future, I'd like to see more of our young Maori women coming forward to join us. They will gain much from sharing in this group. When we first started, many of our ladies were very shy and inexperienced in speaking, but after a while they were able to stand up and express themselves with confidence, and present their own ideas and points of view. I would like to see it grow and even set up other centres. In Auckland there is so much work that could be done; and it is very satisfying, because it is based on aroha right through.</p>

<p>Ka nui tenei, nei? My dear friends I hope you don't get too hoha reading this. I was involved in many aspects of Te Unga Waka, but when Pa Ryan asked me to write something, I decided to talk about the two Women's Leagues. May Te Unga Waka continue to be a place to meet and learn from each other and support each other.</p>

<p>Hei konei ra. Kei te mihi tonu te Whanau o Whaiora, o te Wai Ariki, ki a koutou katoa. Tena koutou, tena koutou, a, tena tatou katoa. Kia toa, kia manawanui. Aroha nui,</p>
