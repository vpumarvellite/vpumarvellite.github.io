  <h1>Fairbanks</h1>

  <p>
    We went to Fairbanks, a town north of Anchorage and spent the day on the Tolovana River 
    at an Indian fishing post, visited an Athebascan village with its distinctive Russian 
    Orthodox church and graveyard. The local Rotary Club shouted us a trip to Point Barrow. 
    This is within the arctic circle. It is the most northerly human settlement on the 
    American Continent.

  <p>
    The highlight for us was our appearance at the Alaskan State fair in Palmer (nr. Anchorage). 
    The surrounding hill tops had the Autumn's first dusting of snow on them.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we left Alaska we were farewelled by our many new friends. We will always cherish 
    their friendship and love. Their customs are very similar to those of the Maori, 
    especially regarding respect for their elders, whanaungatanga, and the honouring of 
    the dignity of every person. Many of their problems are the same as ours; loss of lands 
    and traditions. But with them it's worse. They have been pushed around for a far longer 
    time and more brutally too and it was harder for them to group together because each 
    different tribe speaks a totally different language.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had a lot to think about as we journeyed back to Godzone. We had stopovers in Portland, 
    Oregon and Los Angeles, where we became ordinary tourists, having a jack at everything 
    and experiencing Disneyland. And, after 24 days, we came down to earth in more ways than 
    one at Mangere. How true it is, that you leave home in order to experience the joy of 
    coming back. Kia ora.
