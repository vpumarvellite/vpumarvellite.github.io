  <h1>Charlie Shelford</h2>
  <h2>Te Toa ki te Whawhai</h3>

  <p>
    From the first days of Te Unga Waka, Charlie and his wife Maisie (Blue) were its constant guardians. 
    They were appointed Wardens and for all the functions they made sure that things went well. 
    No damage, no nuisance to neighbours, no boozey good-nights in Clyde Street. Mostly a stern word from Charlie was enough; 
    something told the would-be troublemakers that Charlie's lean frame packed a punch.

    In front of me is a piece of paper, fifty years old. It is the despatch, written in the middle of the Libyan campaign ... 
    "I wish to recommend Pte Shelford for an immediate award. During a night attack by this Battalion on the 14th December against 
    the first line of positions at Gazala he showed outstanding heroism and courage. After the first entrenchments had been taken, 
    his section carried on with the Platoon Commander for a distance of 300 yards to a ridge. The PL Commander then discovered that 
    his section was now isolated from the extreme left flank of the battalion and was being fired on from the right rear and from 
    their left flank. Pte Shelford volunteered to cover the 300 yards to the Enemy firing from the rear and clean it out. 
    Meanwhile the Enemy on the left were sweeping the area with anti-tank guns, MMGs and LMGs as well as rifle fire. 
    Notwithstanding the intensity of the Enemy fire from his flank and his front Pte Shelford covered the 300 yds walking and 
    running and firing his Spandau machine gun from the hip. When he was about 20 yds from the trench he was hit in rapid 
    succession by 3 grenades in the legs. Badly wounded and dazed he attempted to bring his Spandau into action but that had been 
    hit and the butt smashed, so even though he was suffering intense agony he threw a Mills bomb into the trench. 
    This brought out the Enemy and by this time his PL Commander and section arrived and took charge of the prisoners. 
    Altogether four Officers and 36 O/Ranks came out of the trenches in the vicinity including the Commander of the Enemy positions. 
    The surrender of the Commander started the collapse of the entire position and ended the Enemy resistance in that area. 
    Pte Shelford's conduct was outstanding even in action which deeds of bravery were numerous and in my opinion and the opinion 
    of the P Commander, certainly merits the Award requested. Then follows signatures and the stamp of General Auchinleck, 
    Commander of the Middle East Forces."

    He was recommended for the Victoria Cross and, if he had been an Officer, it would probably have been granted. 
    He was awarded an Immediate Distinguished Conduct Medal. This was pretty good for a Private. 
    He was actually in the "glasshouse" when the award arrived and he had to be speedily cleaned up and given special leave.

    There are dozens of stories about Charlie's exploits and his attitude. Another time when they were due for a spot of leave, 
    the orderly ordered him to wear his DCM ribbon. Then about midnight there was a call from the Red Cap officer that he had a man 
    in custody for "being a nuisance and what's more ... he's got a DCM ribbon which he must have stolen!" 
    Next morning all Charlie would say was, "It's your b .. fault. You made me wear it. They didn't run the others in."
