  <h1>From Kaumatua Dave King</h1>

  <p>A very active group formed in Puhinui, with Harry and Miria Cassidy, Violet and Lucky Williams, Monty and Rita Hunia, Liza and John Zarich, Joe and Kuini Matthews, Ike and Martha Topia, Kiri Topia and Martha Matthews.</p>

  <p>This was Pa Matiu's group and they had a wonderful spirit.</p>

  <p>The term for President was three years. After that you could be elected for another term, but then you had to stand aside for someone else. When Charlotte's term ended, Miria Hotere became President. She did two terms and then Wiki was elected. After his term I took over and had two terms.</p>

  <p>One of the rules was that as Legionaries we were not allowed to handle money in any shape or form. This was because it kept our motives pure and no one could accuse us of being in it for the money. This rule caused a few problems when we were drumming up support for the building of our Maori centre. Some people thought that if we were already visiting homes, we could sell raffle tickets or collect "votes" for the different Queens. But we stuck with the rule. If we wanted to take part in the money raising, (and most of us did), then we had to do it at another time and not as Legionaries.</p>

  <p>We younger members had a great example from the elders like Aki Hotere, Joe Topia and his wife. They were so full of faith.</p>

  <p>Besides visiting we were given the work of organising Retreats, especially the women's Retreat, which was always a great success. At these Retreats we would meet other Maori women from all over the country.</p>

  <p><em>(Here is part of a report October 1964)</em><br>
  The four Maori Praesidia of the Legion of Mary in the city and suburbs are continuing their wonderful apostolic work among their own people, bring the Rosary Crusade to homes, visiting new areas, arranging instructions and Baptisms and in many other ways helping the priests in their parish work. Some 40 Catholic Maori are working as Active Members, assisted by many Auxiliaries. The Maori Praesidia are also arranging another pilgrimage to Russell to take place at Labour Weekend.</p>

  <p>Another activity which we undertook was to take part in the CCD (Confraternity of Christian Doctrine.) June and I were asked to take the courses being offered then by Father (later Bishop) Mackey and Father Donnelly. I must confess that after a day's work in the tannery, Father's gentle voice, teaching us about church history was like a lullaby! Also at this time there was the tragic car smash when June's husband was killed and she herself spent a long time in hospital.</p>

  <p>The years have passed now. Styles have changed. But the value and work of the Legion is still needed. There's still need to visit hospitals and prisons and people confined to home or young families that need contacts in the big city. Perhaps some charismatic person from our families will come up with a new impetus.</p>

  <p>The Legion is still doing traditional work in New Zealand, but also tackling modern problems like street-kids and drugs. It's also helping in many countries with poor living standards, where they are turning back to their spiritual roots. In the most recent Legion magazines you can read of the excellent work being done in places we hardly known about ... Ghana, Nigeria, Liberia, Benin, Gabon, Chad ... One report from Liberia reads: " ... visited prison compounds ... went into Refugee Home ... manned a Book Barrow in the market .. helped with alcoholics." Uganda has had more than its share of problems, but it has a Legion membership of 26,000 plus another 10,000 Auxiliaries.</p>

  <p>May I finish this article by remembering all those lovely people who have gone to their reward. Haere e nga mate, haere ki to tatou Whaea ki a Maria ki tana Tamaiti hoki, a Hehu. Haere, haere, haere. Also to those members still with us, thank you for the great work you did, and which some of you are still doing.</p>

  <p>May Te Unga Waka become again a centre and a source of inspiration for everyone. Many Happy Returns of your Birthday and Silver Jubilee. Kia Kaha, Kia toa, kia manawanui hoki. Tena koutou, kia ora mai ano tatou.</p>
