  <h1>ST ANNE'S HOSTEL</h1>

  <p>
    The Catholic Schools were always helpful when we wanted venues for meetings. One place we "adopted" was St. Anne's Hostel in Shelly Beach Road. It started in a small way. The Missionary Sisters of the Society of Mary have a great presence in the islands of the Pacific. The war disrupted their work and quite a number came to Auckland. Never ones to sit still, they helped a lot of families around Ponsonby, Herne Bay and Grey Lynn.

    At first they depended on the hospitality of the Mercy Sisters at St Mary's Ponsonby till Mother Mary Rose bought a house in Anglesea Street. Bishop Liston invited them to share in the work of the Maori Mission. So in 1952 they decided to buy a bigger house in Shelly Beach Road to give accommodation to the young women coming to the big smoke. The elder Barney Hotere and Pat Mendes teamed up with Charlotte and Harry Cassidy and got their families helping to clean up the property and do some concreting and other jobs. Pa Tewano used to say Mass every day at the Sisters' place.

    They ran a Queen Carnival with candidates from Motukaraka, Pawarenga, Akarana, Waihou, Panguru and Mitimiti. Millie Mendes (now Mrs Rudolph) was winner and the coronation took place in Fanshawe Street Maori Centre. Dame Whina was very busy at the time, setting up the Maori Women's Welfare League and agitating for better housing, but she found time to come along and be part of the effort. St Anne's was the first city home for a lot of the young girls. There are still a few Maori who board there, but the majority of the boarders now come from Asia and the Pacific Islands.
