  <h2>Te Whau</h2>

  <p>
    We can never forget the work the Lundon family did for us – Pat and Nan and Mary (Davis), the best secretary we
    ever had. She was knocked down and killed in Sandringham Road on the way home from Housie. That was a tangi
    I’ll never forget. We had been so depressed with the tragedy, but as we carried her out to the hearse for the
    journey north, it seemed to all of us, as if a weight was lifted from us and she wanted us to come back from the
    darkness to the ao marama. Sally Te Whiu – we miss her cheerful voice calling to us across the playground.
    She’s gone now and Bill too. Then there’s Martha Cash, Dan Rapira, Mary Daniels and my own wife Ann.
    And so many more. To them all we say, “Haere ra. Farewell. We’ll meet again.”

    Those of us who are still in the land of the living are all a bit older. Some are not able to help physically, but we
    know that they still work with and encourage the young. Out here in West Auckland we’ve long cherished the idea
    of having a marae and whare hui of our own. It would not be in opposition to Te Unga Waka, but it would
    supplement it. Several of our people have held the Chair and other Offices at Te Unga Waka. When Teresa Tepania
    was our Chairperson, she would say, “Come on you people, when are we going to get our marae?”

    Eventually we compromised by backing up the re-building of the old church hall of St Mary’s, Avondale; what was
    originally the old church. We poured in many thousands of dollars and a lot of energy. But we are very proud of the
    result. We named it <strong>Te Whau</strong>. Te Whau was a very important plant in olden times and gave its name to
    the district and is also our Maori name for Mount Eden. We had our first tangi there when we brought in the body
    of Dan Rapira. Dan had been a guide and mentor for so many young families coming into the city. So we’re sure we
    have a good patron looking after us in heaven.
