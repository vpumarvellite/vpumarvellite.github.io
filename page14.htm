    <h1>VOCATION</h1>
    <p>
        In 1955 one of the students at Hato Petera College decided to try for the priesthood. Henare Arekatera Tate of Motuti, Hokianga offered his life as a pirihi. It was over ten years since Pa Wiremu had been ordained as a Marist Father. Henare wanted to become a priest of the Diocese of Auckland to work among his own people. The people were very happy; but luckily, they didn't get carried away and try to make him Pope right away. In fact, Henare was looking a bit apprehensively at the years lying ahead. "Take your tennis racquet with you," said Pa Teo, "and the time will fly past." But it was a tough time, being so far away from home: Holy Name Seminary in Christchurch for Philosophy studies and Mosgiel, Dunedin for Theology.

    <h2>ATTITUDES</h2>
    <p>
        Many Maori families in their early days in Auckland got to know the local priests like Fr. Hyde of St. Benedicts. They joined in school and church projects and felt they belonged. All went well when they could sing the familiar hymns and the Catechist could chant the Mass prayers in Maori. The priest still said the Mass in Latin. But Pakeha people were used to a silent Mass which they followed with their books, and they wouldn't dream of singing hymns without a choir and an organ to back them up. So our lonely Maori family would feel strange and often wouldn't return. Pakeha people couldn't understand this. The priests too were sometimes hurt and felt that anyone wanting something different must be losing their Faith. To them the Mass was the Mass—hoiano! So the two Missioners had to be very patient and try to explain and help the Pakeha priests understand Maori feelings.

        Monsignor Hyde and others like him were a great help. His collection for the Maori Mission was the biggest just about every year. He used to tell his people, "I want a silent collection—never mind those coppers or shillings—just let me hear the rustle of paper money!" Fr. Gardiner of Panmure was another great helper who gave us his hall for fund-raising.

    <h2>321 MANUKAU ROAD</h2>
    <p>
        In 1959 Pa Matiu persuaded the Dean to buy a bigger house for the Missioner, where people could meet in comfort. Obviously too, there was going to be a need for more priests to help in the work to meet the needs of the growing Maori population. 321 Manukau Road belonged to a Doctor. Owing to a court case, the house was up for a quick sale. The house was a fine two-storey place, with a big sitting room, and carpeted throughout. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Dean was reluctant to use Maori Mission money for it, so he bought it with money from Mill Hill. But he wanted Pa Matiu to pull up the carpet, because Mill Hill Men were not supposed to have such luxuries in their homes. So Pa Matiu had to talk fast, to persuade him that it would cost more to varnish the floors. Up to then it had been the policy of the Society of St Joseph (Mill Hill) not to purchase land or property.
