    <h1>THE UNIFORM</h1>
    <p>
        Rangimarie was having trouble with their uniform. The first pari was a white poutama with a little white cross on the black background. Miria was in bed sick at the time. They brought the sample along and spread it on the end of her bed. "The only thing missing," she said, "is the No te Hohonutanga!" (The De Profundis). That was the end of that. In the end it came down to the night before the Ordination. Pa Matiu finished a sample of the new design and rushed it across town to Miria for her approval. Everyone was happy with it. So it was back to 321 Manukau Road and "eyes down and sewing" with Maria Parker, her daughter Teresa (Puti), and Pa Matiu himself on his own machine. They worked into the night.

    <h2>WHAKATAPUNGA HEI PIRIHI (ORDINATION)</h2>
    <p>
        Ordination day was a Saturday. You'd think it was the final of the World Cup. Auckland was invaded. Hokianga emptied out in buses, cars, jalopies, and trains. People came from Mosgiel and Christchurch and Bluff; from Poneke and Otaki; from Wanganui River and Taranaki; from Opotiki, Whakatane, Rotorua, Hastings, Wairoa, Gisborne, Ruatoria, Taupo, Taumarunui, Tauranga, Waikato, and the four Tai e Wha.

    <p>
        Across the square and through the crowd came the Cross-Bearer and acolytes, followed by a procession of seventy priests in black and white kakahu pirihi. Then followed Archbishop James Michael Liston, Bishop (later Cardinal) Delargy, and Bishop Foley of Fiji. Then came the four young candidates, in white albs: Henare Tate, Denis Browne (now Bishop of Auckland), David Welch, and Nick Alleman.
    </p>

    <p>
        The age-old ceremony, all in Latin, was very serious and very impressive. Spiritual taonga were given to these young men: to bring Christ to their people in the Eucharist and Reconciliation, and by their preaching of the Good News. All the priests went forward to place their hands on the heads of each of the four. An audible sigh went through the whole cathedral when Pa Wiremu, the first Maori priest, stood before Pa Henare to pass on his own mana pirihi.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end, Monsignor Curran stood up and announced, "Please, could we have just the close families of the new priests to come forward for their first blessings." What a laugh! Everyone stood up and advanced en masse on poor Pa Henare. Eventually, sanity prevailed and the newly ordained priests were escorted across to Liston House for breakfast. All had been fasting from the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
        Archbishop Liston advised that Pa Henare should have a quiet day in seclusion. He was still under a spiritual tapu and the time to give himself to his people was after he celebrated his first Holy Mass. So he spent the rest of the day quietly at his old school, Hato Petera.
    </p>
    <p>
        The crowds in the city were given a buffet lunch at the Catholic Social Centre, Pitt Street. Then in the evening, the Rangimarie gave the performance of their lives. Every item was cheered, especially Johnny Tapiata's song, "E Koro, Pa Henare e."
