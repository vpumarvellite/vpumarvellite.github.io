  <h1>Te Whau</h1>

  <p>Te Whau was the host for Wednesday. (For those not up with the play, Te Whau is the name of the Avondale Catholic Maori Society.)  The day itself was designated the Rangatahi Day - for the young people. It began on a very practical note with lectures from people working In the Iwi Transition Agency and the New Zealand Employment Service. In the evening Archive Films were shown in the Kohanga Reo Whare, dealing with the Hokianga, Rawene and the old-time Waitangi Huihuinga.</p>

  <p>Thursday was designated a day of rest, but the kitchen was kept busy, with Pare Hauraki doing the honours. Uncle Ben Tawhiti's band came along to provide music for our cocktail evening. Some families had arranged a Whakapapa Evening to search their family genealogies.  This was a good opportunity with so many people coming together.</p>

  <p>Friday had two main events, the Stations of the Cross and the visit by the Aitutaki people. The Stations of the Cross were dramatically illustrated by the Poi from Christ the Maori. This was the first time it had been done in Chapel and we wanted to see if it could be performed while moving between the Stations of the Cross. But we had to settle for a static performance because of the crowd in the chapel and the room needed to do the Poi. (Perhaps another time, in a big church with plenty of room.) </p>

  <p>Afterward we welcomed in the Aitutaki people. They have strong links with Te Unga Waka, often using it as their marae for important occasions like the Hair-Cutting ceremonies. After the official welcome they gave us a delightful colourful performance.  Whai Ora were the main hosts that day.</p>

    Saturday was our Sports Day. Two buses took the visitors over to Hato Petera. The Games proposed were Netball, Basketball, Tennis,
    Table Tennis, Golf, Bowls, Badminton, Rugby, League, Touch Rugby, a Marathon and/or a fun run.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was a most enjoyable day. Not all of the sports took place, but some of us, with visions of our by-gone youth, joined in the Touch Rugby.
    The Wests, coached by Pat Mendes, came out the winners. The golf too was very popular at the North Shore Links.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the meantime, Housie was in full swing at Te Unga Waka. This is our "Bread-Winner" which provides most of the finance for our marae.
    For a while it was dying on its feet, as less and less people turned up on Thursday nights. But now we have it on Saturdays and it's very
    popular again. Perhaps this is the time to put in a word of praise for our Housie Committee. Over the years there have been dedicated people
    who gave up many hours to keep the housie running smoothly.
  </p>

  <p>
    On Saturday evening we had Karakia first and then a Variety Show called "Irirangi" - "Showcase in Motion". With the Mangere Marae band,
    we had another fabulous evening. Our hosts were the Catholic Women's League.
