<h1>PA TUERLINGS & PA BROWN</h1>

<p>And Donna wrote to thank me for the wonderful time she had in Knock-na-gree Camp for the Auckland children. She was a kid then, and 20 years later she felt she had to write a letter of thanks. If ever I appreciated a letter, it was hers. So we must have done some good, somewhere. I never realised I would be so susceptible and thrilled with a word of thanks.</p>

<p>A final story comes to mind. There was a tangi at Te Unga Waka and Liza Tipene was having a good laugh with Louise (wife of Joe Nuku who was a fruiterer in Point Chevalier). Liza thought she should explain what the joke was. "Father, when Louise and Joe had been married for a while, they had no children. So she asked me - 'Liza, you are a church woman. Can you recommend a Saint who will help me to have children?' So I recommended her to pray to St Gerard Majella. And sure enough, it worked. It worked too well. Now, with all her kids she was asking me, 'Liza, can you recommend any saint who could help me to stop?' Liza said, 'Ae, me inoi ki a Hohepa!' That's why they were both laughing.</p>

<p>No reira, koutou katoa, I would like to thank all people affiliated to Te Unga Waka for their kindness shown to me and also to all the Mill Hill Fathers during our work in Auckland.</p>

<p>Aroha nui, na</p>

<pre>FATHER TONY BROWN</p>
<p>Tena koutou katoa, te whanau o Te Unga Waka.  My fondest memories of sharing in the work of Te Unga Waka was the opportunity given to me to live at 321 Manukau Road for six months, just after leaving the seminary in 1983-84.</p>

<p>The help and assistance of the Mill Hill Fathers, the Sisters and laity and the Tamaki Mission Team was instrumental in responding more wholeheartedly to a vocation in the priesthood.</p>

<p>Early Whai Ora days in Otara connected me to Te Unga Waka. Boarding School days at Hato Petera kept within me a close affiliation with Te Unga Waka - also Hostel days at Gillies Ave.</p>

<p>So Te Unga Waka has on more ways than one, been in and a part of my personal history and development.</p>

<p>The early days of the Runanga at Te Unga Waka were at times awkward and turbulent, but one saving grace in it all was knowing all the people involved, loving them then, and loving them all still today in whatever situation life has taken them.</p>

<p>So, HAPPY ANNIVERSARY to Te Unga Waka -<br>
HE KOHANGA WHARE E KITEA<br>
