<div class="narrative">
  <p>To make sure of the safety aspects, Pa Matiu got K. Tapper to look it over. Ken was a building engineer who had recently been very helpful to the Catholics of Rotorua in building the new St Michael's church. Now he advised about the safety aspects and urged Pa Matiu to go ahead. There were conferences with the town planner, Mr Butterworth and with Mr Milne, the Mayor of One Tree Hill.</p>

  <p>They were very helpful and became great friends of Te Unga Waka. Graham Smith was chosen as the architect and he treated it as a personal challenge to develop the site. Pa Matiu began to make a list of people who helped and in the last year of his life, he wanted to make a roll of honour, so that no one would be forgotten. However, death intervened; so perhaps we are just meant to remember them in our prayers.</p>

  <p>Before the new hall could arise, there was a lot of cleaning up and demolition work to be done. It was hoped to have the opening before Christmas 1965, but that was too optimistic. It was also realised that the making of the Chapel would take more planning and time.</p>

  <h2>MARCH 5th 1966</h2>
  This date was chosen so that the Governor General Sir Bernard Fergusson could officiate and Archbishop Liston could bless the Centre. Sir Bernard had a lot of real aroha for Maori people. He had learned Maori as a lad in the 1920s, when his father, Sir Charles was Governor General.</p>

  <p>Once more, all Maori roads led to Auckland. Of course it didn't have the same impact as the Ordination, but over 2,000 gathered, many of them representing other Churches and Tribal groups.</p>

  <p>Pa Petera Bierbooms had just joined the team and he took over the crowd management with his walkie-talkie and observation post in the upper dormitory. Clyde Street was closed and the Traffic Cops and Maori Wardens did a great job, keeping all in order until the challenge could be made and accepted.</p>

  <p>"Most of the troubles since the races, Maori and Pakeha first met and mingled, have arisen out of nothing more sinister than ignorance of each other (Young people) I wish you well, as you take over the torch O Christendom and Maoridom."</p>

  <p>2,000 people sat down to lunch. In the afternoon there was a Concert, in the evening a Ball. The following day (Sunday) the Tumuaki of the Maori Mission, Fr Aarts, said the first Miha Maori in the Hall, after which 500 sat down to kai. As Iriaka wrote in the Visitor's Book, "He Taonga Pai". We have a real treasure. Since that day it has become more so with the passing years. The number of our loved ones who have lived, worked and spoken on the marae of Te Unga Waka and then rested there when their earth's journey was over, have made it a place of honour and tapu.</p>
