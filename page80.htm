<p>The idea of a special separate Order did not succeed because several other Maori girls who wanted to become Teaching or Nursing Sisters, went to other Religious Orders like the Sisters of Mercy or the Sisters of St Joseph. Kare, whom we have known for many years as Sister Dorothy, joined the Marist Sisters.</p>

<p>Martha came to Auckland where she worked mostly looking after the sick and elderly. She became a good supporter of Pa Tewano in his work among the Maori people. At this time Ron Cash began to accompany her everywhere and proposed marriage. "No," said Martha, "I'm too old!" But Ron persisted. He recognised that special character in Martha which cared for everybody. "I need you to mother me," he said. So in the end she gave in, so long as Ron understood that her Maori people came first in her life.</p>

<h2>Proverbs – He whakatauki</h2>

<p class="maori-greeting">He rei nga niho, he paraoa nga kauae</p>
<p>This was a favourite proverb of Pa Teo when he wanted to encourage people or to comment on a big project. The decisions were the teeth (nga niho); they look like tusks (he rei) – so there must be the jawbone of a whale (he paraoa) holding them all together!</p>

<p class="maori-greeting">He nui maunga, ekore e taea te whakaneke<br>
He ngaru moana, ma te ihu o te waka e wahi</p>
<p>This proverb was used by Pa Kereti Aarts when he was at Hato Petera College, to tell the pupils to go about things in the right way. A big project might look daunting like a mountain (he nui maunga), but if you think of it as a huge wave (he ngaru moana), your canoe prow (te ihu o te waka) will slice through it.</p>

<p class="maori-greeting">He tumu herenga waka, no runga, no raro</p>
<p>A proverb used by our Kaiarahi, Eddie Tapara from Taranaki, when any particular group wanted to claim Te Unga Waka – "No, Te Unga Waka is the anchorage for north or south people."</p>

<p class="maori-greeting">He toa takitini taku toa, ehara i te toa takitahi</p>
<p>A significant group of our people are from Ngati Kahungunu. This was a saying of their famous leader Tutohu Ariki. It was made into a song by Kingi Ihaka's father. Our strength is that of the whole group – not just of the star performer.</p>
