<h1>PA WIREMU TUERLINGS</h1>

<p>When you asked for a little contribution to the Silver Jubilee Magazine I sat down and thought back and what struck me was - that all the people who came to mind are all dead and buried. Haere e nga mate. Haere, haere, haere.</p>

<p>A little scene came to mind - Pa Matiu, Pa Petera and myself, gazing up at the ceiling in the main hall where some of the tiles had come loose. The painters had erected a big scaffolding on wheels but they had gone off work for the night.</p>

<p>"Why didn't they put the ceiling panels right, while they were up there?" asked Pa Matiu. "Hold that thing steady," said Pa Petera and he began to climb up. But the thing was shaky. He got about half way up, then came down very fast. So Pa Matiu had a go, and you've got to give it to the old man. He got right to the top and fixed the panels. Pa Petera and I were at the bottom pushing. Eventually we rolled him towards the stage where there are two hot air outlets, high up. We put him in front of one of them and turned on the central heating! Both of them are gone now. Haere korua ki te maramatanga mutunga kore.</p>

<p>I thought of Pauline and her pakeha husband Jack Russel. When Pauline and Jack looked after the customary evening meal in Te Unga Waka, Jack always had special steaks ma nga pirihi! Beautiful steaks!</p>

<p>I thought of Maisy and Charlie Shelford (both gone now too). They were in charge of Te Unga Waka Bowling Club. They kept a faithful record of the finances of the Bowling Club even though they never amounted to more than a few dollars. Every single cent was duly recorded and managed. They gave their financial records to Pa Petera for auditing. On one side was written INCOME and on the other side OUTCOME. God bless their faithful souls.</p>

<p>I think of the Legion of Mary of which I was the spiritual director. We met every Monday in the sacristy of St Patrick's Cathedral: Wiki Hotere, Martha Rapira, Bubbles, Weka, Pat Peita, Dave King, Liza Tipene. One day Father Keating (also dead now) who was a curate at St Patrick's at the time called in after the meeting was over. He said, "Let us have a cup of tea." and started getting out the saucers and cups and doing all the work. Liza Tipene (now also gone) said to Father Keating, "Father, you don't need celibacy! You are doing quite well on your own."</p>

<p>What was the highlight of my stay in Auckland? It is hard to say. But one of the highlights was in 1988. I was in Tokoroa at the time when I received a letter from Donna Rapira. She had read in Zealandia that I had been given a knighthood by the Dutch Queen. Donna wrote: "Only now, through Zealandia, I know how to spell your name."</p>
