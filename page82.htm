  <h2>MEMOIR OF PA MATIU</h2>

  <p class="maori-greeting">Tena koutou katoa te whanau o Te Unga Waka.</p>

  <p>
    Don't get too much of a shock when you see this little article.
    But I've been asked to write down some of my memories
    of Pa Matiu. I want to do it, because memories are
    precious things and we should do our best to pass them
    on to the next generation.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Pa Matiu came to Auckland from Panguru,
    Father Hyde asked him to stay at St Benedict's till he
    could get a place for himself. He was looking for a house
    to stay where he could look after the Maori of South
    Auckland. My husband, Haupuru had died in 1949 and
    I was left with my little boy Edward, so I was happy to
    look after Pa Matiu.
  </p>

  <p>
    We lived first of all in the house he found in Wilkinson
    Road, Ellerslie. It wasn't a Centre or Church, but it did
    have a Prayer Room and Pa was given permission to
    reserve the Blessed Sacrament there. So it was like a
    little chapel.
  </p>

  <p>
    His job was to range far and wide all over South
    Auckland helping the Maori people to keep their faith –
    saying Mass in different churches and whizzing around
    in his little VW. He was very proud of that car. He kept a
    check of every penny spent, from its original price to its
    eventual sale, and he proudly announced it cost only one
    and a half pence per mile. I don't know what that is in modern
    money, but it's not much.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pa was like that in everything. He was very careful.
    When he had a bright idea he worked on it carefully. He
    would talk it over with anyone who would listen. He did
    tend to go on a bit. But it was no use trying to run away
    when he was explaining anything.

  <p>
    It was a fluke that Pa Matiu ever came to New
    Zealand. After he was ordained priest in 1935, he
    worked in Holland as an organiser. His job was to go
    around parishes, giving talks and showing colour slides
    to encourage young men to join the Mill Hill Fathers. He
    also co-ordinated the fundraising. When World War II
    started, he kept to this work, but thought he would never
    actually be able to go overseas as a missionary.
  </p>

  <p>
    But after the War, a lot of Dutch emigrants were
    invited by New Zealand to come and make a new home
    here. In 1949 a boat full of emigrants was ready to
    sail, but there was no Catholic Chaplain for them. At
    least sixty percent of them were Catholics, so Pa Matiu
    was asked if he would like the trip, which would last
    about six weeks.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was a nice change for him and he enjoyed the
    relaxed atmosphere; no telephones, lots of excited
    young people going to a new life away from war-torn
    Europe – and only a little bit sea-sick. However, when he
    arrived in Wellington, there was a telegram from Mill Hill,
    telling him to stay in New Zealand and join the Maori
    Mission.
