    <h1>Bishop Mackey – Greetings from Bishop John Mackey</h1>

    <p>Agnes Beach is given the hoe by Bishop Mackey</p>

    <p>E te iwi, tena koutou. Tena koutou e hari nei i tenei, te huritau rua tekau ma rima o Te Unga Waka. Ka nui taku mihi ki a koutou katoa.</p>

    <p>Twenty five years is a short time in the life of a people, but it is a long time in the life of a person. Te Unga Waka is now twenty five years old. It still has a long, long life before it, if that is what you want and will work for.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Te Unga Waka in twenty five years has seen the people die; the people born; the babies baptised; the people married; and the people mourn and rejoice. Because this is God's house all that human activity has been given a blessing, a meaning and a quality that transforms the human experience, the Maori experiences into a Christian experience.</p>

    <p>At Te Unga Waka - this is my prayer for you Ko te paki no Ruhi e horahia ki waho - May peace be spread everywhere. And that peace of soul is the special gift that Jesus gives us.</p>

    <p>So I pray, on this Jubilee, that you will continue, as you did with me, to give loving loyalty to your priests, the Mill Hill Fathers who are yours in a special way, and now also to the Diocesan Priests who have been appointed to carry on the work, and to Bishop Denis, as well as constant support to one another in making Te Unga Waka what it was founded for twenty five years ago, a house for Emmanuel (God-with-us) and a home for his children. May the Lord bless and keep you;</p>

    <p>The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you; The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.</p>
    
    <p>Ma lhowa koutou e manaaki, Maana koutou e tiaki, Ma lhowa e mea kia tiaho tona mata ki a koutou, Maana ano hoki koutou e atawhai, Ma lhowa tona kanohi e whakaara ki a koutou, Maana ano e tuku te rangimarie ki a koutou</p>

    <p>Aroha nui</p>

    <p>Bishop John Mackey</p>
