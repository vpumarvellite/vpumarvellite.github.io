  <h1>Legion of Mary</h1>

  <p>Most of us found this a difficult job. We'd go out in pairs and each take a side of the street and go and knock on every door! You got a few people who slammed the door in your face. We all had our own funny stories to tell, like "When I came to number 49, it was a saw-mill and I didn't know where to knock : President: 'Why didn't you knock on wood'? Ha ha!" If there were too many houses with no one at home, Pa Tewano would ask us to go back at a time when they would be home.</p>

  <p>On all visitations the idea was to introduce oneself as a member of the Legion of Mary and if the vibes were right you invited them to become an auxiliary member. These were members who said the prayers each day, but did not take part in the weekly meetings or the work programmes.</p>

  <p>It sounds easy enough, but for many of us it was very tough learning how to introduce yourself to people you didn't know. When there were plenty of us, we did regular visits to all the hospitals around Auckland, even as far out as Middlemore, (which required two buses to get there) and to all the private hospitals. But when our numbers were fewer, we would go on visitation when we heard that someone was in hospital. It was the same with Oakley Mental Hospital. The Pt Chevalier praesidium, which looked after Oakley, invited our Maori praesidium to help with their visiting when some of the patients were Maori.</p>

  <p>I was fortunate in having Mrs Liza Tipene among my mentors in the early days. In one street we visited several homes where Liza was known. But she kept off any spiritual talk. In fact, they seemed mostly to swap ideas about the form of race-horses. Later on I realised that these families would have resented being asked anything about religion, and Liza's friendly chatter helped them to keep in touch for the times when they really needed their Faith. Perhaps I shouldn't quote Liza, because she was a rule unto herself. But what a character! If only we had some more like her now! She also knew every corner dairy, because you knew when visitation was over, Liza took you to the nearest dairy for a lovely big ice-cream. And, never mind if the bus you were going to catch had already taken off! Liza would stand out in the road and with one wave of her hand would bring them to a stop. The drivers all knew her and her "God bless you, darling".</p>

  <p>The only one who had a car was John Ryan and it was a sad day when he and Rosie went to live in Otahuhu. They formed a praesidium for that area. The Senatus (Central Committee) had been asking us to divide up, because we had a large number of members. But we were happy working together, and we only split up when we went to live in more distant areas. Kuini Matiu and Bella and Joe Harris started the Maori praesidium in Manurewa. After a while, when Whai Ora became established, Otahuhu split into two.</p>
