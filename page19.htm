    <h1>TE MIHA TUATAHI</h1>
    <p>
        On Sunday again it was unbelievable. The Cathedral and Square were thronged with people. How wonderful the old hymns sounded – Aroha Mai, e Hehu atawhai, E Hehu i te Tapenakara … "I was watching the roof!" said Archbishop Liston, "in case it lifted off!" "He mamae, he mamae!" were the opening words of Pa Teo's kauwhau, as he thought of all the loved ones whom death had called away before they could share in this happy moment. At the end of the Mass, Pa Matiu climbed up into the old pulpit, "Inaianei, me haere tatou ki te Trades Hall." This somehow tickled the fancy of the youngsters and for days afterwards you could get a laugh by saying, "Haere tatou ki te Trades Hall."

        The hall was turned into a marae and Dame Whina and Pa Kereti Aarts came forward with the challenger to meet Pa Henare. The kaumatua, Manuka Henare, stood up ki te hiki i te tapu – to lift the tapu from Pa Henare and his ope. The cake stood there in all its glory, the corners patterned like wheat and grapes, symbolizing the Eucharist. In its centre was a waka with a net of fish and the words, "E Pa Henare, tukua tou kupenga ki te wahi hohonu." (let down your net into the deep water).

        After the first ritual speeches, Wiki had the job of explaining the procedures for Kai. There had to be several sittings, each one could hold 410 people. So different coloured tickets were issued for different sittings. The V.I.P.s were given Blue tickets for the first sitting. "Haere mai nga tikiti puruu!" (Come on Blue Tickets!) was like saying, "Come on Blue Bloods!" We had a good laugh, but Wiki was very patient. Eventually the first sitting went up the road to the old wooden hall (long since disappeared to make way for the motorway junction). Feeding your manuhiri has always been serious business in Maoritanga. A lot of food was donated: sacks of kutai and pipi, kumara and potatoes, a dozen poaka, a hundred and fifty chickens, etc. A van had been hired to go round collecting the gifts for food.   </p>


 <p> While each sitting got down to the serious business of eating, the others fulfilled the whakatauki, "Ko te kai a te rangatira, he korero." They used the Trades Hall as the marae to mihi, to waiata or just ki te noho noaiho. The
wardens from the seven Committees of the Queen Carnivals made sure that everything went smoothly, with great teamwork. There were no grumbles or grouses Everyone had smiles, even the dishwashers who were in it up to their elbows, from 1 o'clock till after 5 p.m. In the afternoon Dame Whina presented Pa Henare with the tohu aroha from the people. It was a chalice of gold and greenstone. The cup and the foot were made of gold, the central knob and the cross on the foot were made of pounamu. Rangimarie sang "E Koro" and "Te Hahi Katorika hei arataki." Everyone cried, it was so moving. After the great orators had spoken, and Dame Whina had issued her challenge, all eyes turned on the young man who was the cause of it all. Pa Henare looked so young and vulnerable, but he was equal to the occasion. Without any tricks of oratory he began very simply with the whakapapa of his spiritual descent from Pompallier, and his debt to his human family and to Pa Wiremu, who need be mokemoke no longer. Then he translated it all into English. And he didn't forget to thank the "powerhouse", te Tari o te Ora (Health Department) otherwise known as Nga Ringa Wera. He went to all the
cooks and workers and gave each his First Blessing. </p>
