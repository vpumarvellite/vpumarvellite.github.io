  <p>There is much that can be written about the Youth Club, but the greatest of all was the growing spirit of Whanau. As youth, we were Brother and Sister who cared for each other, in good times and in bad times, and believe it, there was plenty of both. Through the blessings that we received many members chose their partners for life from within the Youth Club. Some moved to chosen careers, to the South Island, the Meatworks, Army, Trades. The branches of the tree were stretching out alright. To adapt a phrase: <em>Ko te Taura whiri a Te Unga Waka.</em></p>

  <p>Everywhere you go you meet someone who remembers those days of the Youth Club. Of course you want to go back sometimes to the fun and fitness of those days, but as Kupe said, <em>"E hoki a Kupe?"</em> It's no use hankering after our lost youth, but the spirit, ae, me hoki ki te wairua whakawhanaunga o aua ra.</p>

  <p>The Silver Jubilee Celebrations were like a Reunion. But it would be nice to have a special Reunion for the old Youth Club, to see where we all are these days. It might help some more to become supporters of the Rangatahi today, as others supported us in our days. Let us pray for our Youth today, for theirs is a greater fight in a more eventful and more bountiful world, engari he Ao Hurihuri.</p>

  <p>Hei kupu whakamutunga.  Kia ngawari mai ki a au mo enei tuhituhinga. Kahore ekore, kua wareware i a au tahi o oku hoa.</p>
