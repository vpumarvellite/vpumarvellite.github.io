<h2>Ahipara</h2>

<p>The kids thought it was great fun, running around with no shoes on, even in the cold. This experience helped us later on when our work took us among different tribal groups.</p>

<p>Ohaki marae, Ahipara, gave us a bit of a scare when we were to perform there. Pumi Taituha who is a knowledgable man, a tohunga, came out with the same ideas which we had in the beginning. There was tension there. Our leaders like Manu, Dave, Julie, Pio and I who were older members at that time, had to make a decision whether to carry on. Father Geboers was a great support in our midst at the time. Pio was very strong on the fact that Tikanga Maori could go together with the whakapono Karaitiana. He had no fear, and as the onus was on him – he was the “dying” character. It gave us confidence to carry on. Pumi was actually coming to the performance, but I think something came up, because I can’t remember him coming.</p>

<p>We grew stronger every time we passed through a testing period like that. Many of our own people of Pawarenga were opposed to the performance. They weren’t going to come, but curiosity got the better of them and they came to see us, expecting lightning to strike us from heaven! But it didn’t worry us for one moment. We believed in what we were doing. Pio was so clear in his mind that he strengthened any waverers. He used to talk things over with me and the children, who showed great understanding, even though they were only little. As I recall, then and now, the evangelizing part of it was very strong among us. <em>Karaiti Te Maori</em> has acted as a catalyst in the understanding of faith and Maoritanga. Breakthroughs have occurred both ways. Aspects of faith in Christ can be explained in Maori philosophical terms and ideas.</p>

<p>I look at the Pastoral Plan for Maori people now and realise that it is part of evangelizing in one’s own culture. We had some great times and made lots of friends. Some ladies, both nuns and lay people, used to look at my husband in his role as Christ and (moved, no doubt, by spiritual values!) they couldn’t get close enough to him!</p>

<p>Sometimes we went in three bus loads, because the children came along and they were a very important part of the group and grew up in a spiritual atmosphere. Now in their teenage years, some of them say they have had enough religion as youngsters, but it is still there, and when the time is ripe it shows itself in their lives. They imbibed a lot of Maori culture on those trips. They have confidence in themselves as Maori and can walk on to any marae and know how to carry themselves.</p>

<p>Of course we have had some difficult moments. You could sense it in the crowds sometimes. How would they react to our performance? Would it be one of those occasions when the audience was too quiet? Was the group putting their heart and soul into it? There were often tears during the performances, from the audience but also from us, even after many times.</p>
