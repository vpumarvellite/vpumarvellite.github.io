    <h1>Father Aarts Sends His Best Wishes</h1>

    <pre>Kei te mihi atu ahau ki a koutou, oku hoa aroha, i te huringa tau Tekau ma Rima o Te Unga Waka.</p>

    <p>As I sit here, far away from you all, my thoughts go back to all the people who worked so hard to get Te Unga Waka built. First of all, the leaders at that time, Pa Matiu, the spiritual leader and Whina Cooper, the President of the Auckland Catholic Maori Society, who worked hard for the Centre, especially organising the money-raising efforts. Some of them 	who worked so hard have gone with Pa Matiu.
    </p>

    <pre>
        Kua ngaro atu i te tirohanga tangata.
        No reira, haere e nga mate, haere ki te kainga tuturu. 
	Here, haere, haere.</p>

    <p>I pray that the Centre will continue to grow as the heart of the Maori life and Maori spirituality and will continue to be an instrument for the evangelizing of Maori culture. </p>

</pre>	Kia nui nga manaakitanga a to tatou Ariki ki a koutou i nga tau kei te heke mai.

	Aroha nui, Pa Kereti - Fr. 9. Carto</p>

        Fr Aarts retired in 1986 to go and live near his sister in their home town of Gilse in the Netherlands.  He is getting a bit frail now and has gone to live in a retirement home for Mill Hill Missionaries.  He is enjoying life there, but finds it hard to write or even type. He enjoys getting news from Aotearoa, especially about the people he knows and the places he lived in, Ngati Tuwharetoa, Whanau a Apanui, Whanau o Hato Petera. His address is FR G AARTS, HUIZE VRIJLAND, POSTBUS 20, 6860 AA OOSTERBEEK, THE NETHERLANDS.
