  <h1>Other Sports</h1>

  <p>Table tennis, Billiards, Badminton, Bowls and Judo all had their devotees.  Judo especially, was enjoyed by all, and our big hero was Mike Tipene, the Commonwealth Champion.</p>

  <p>Memories remain of a humming, youthful community Youth Centre, Sport was our life.</p>

  <h2>Te Taha Māori</h2>

  <p>Every Sunday the hall echoed to the sound of Action Songs and Haka, Poi and Patere.  At that time Johnnie Tapiata was our main coach. He composed many of our songs and brought in specialists to help us. Peter Awatere wrote a play for us which we performed at Western Springs. </p>

  <p>At that time Waitangi Day was not a national holiday. It was called Northland Day, and Colonel Awatere felt this was not good enough. So we had this play of the Signing of the Treaty. Uncle Eric was resplendent in top hat and tails. I forget who he represented, but he signed the Treaty with great aplomb.</p>

  <p>We also had great tutors in whai-korero, Totoni and Wiki, and sometimes Tim Davis. Dave and Dickie Hotere were the experts who showed us the art of the Wero (Challenge).</p>

  <p>The girls specialised in tukutuku and weaving. Some of the older ladies came along to teach.  I remember especially Maisie Shelford who was so dedicated. She made the Holy Family panel for the Chapel and the Stations of the Cross. Pa Henare got quite good, considering that Whina once told him, "E Pa, ko koe tetahi pirihi dumb mo te mahi tukutuku!"</p>

  <p>he boys learned carving, but I'm afraid I wasn't a good pupil for Morgan Puru who was our tutor.  My mind was on other pursuits, if you know what I mean.</p>
