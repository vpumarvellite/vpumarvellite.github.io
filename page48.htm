<h1>Rangimarie go to Mosgiel</h1>

<p>Our two longest trips were to Christchurch and Dunedin. We completely filled a commercial flight going down to the 75th Jubilee of the Seminary at Mosgiel. It was the day when the clocks went forward one hour - and Bob and Gemma and their family had the thrill of seeing the plane take off, while they were still on the Mangere Bridge! They caught the next flight down and nearly beat us on to the marae as Arai - Te-Uru welcomed us. Then we joined the locals in welcoming their Manuhiri Tuarangi, the Australian Cardinal Wright. He was lavish in his praise of Christ the Maori.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday was a full day. Our Miha Maori was very emotional. Then we farewelled 1. The Cardinal, 2. The Papal Delegate, 3. The Bishop of Tonga. Then we farewelled ourselves and got on the buses back to the airport. For the flight back to Christchurch we had two planes. The luckier people got in the smaller Cook's flight. Because it flew lower you got a great view of the countryside.</p>
