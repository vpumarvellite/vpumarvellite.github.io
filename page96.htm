  <h1>Charlie Shelford – Civilian Life</h1>

  <p>
    Sorry there isn't room for all the stories, but here is one from civilian life. Charlie worked for a 
    drainage contractor and eventually wanted to set up a business for himself. He had to go with 
    another nine candidates to sit the City Council exam. The young lady supervisor handed out the 
    questions and two sheets of foolscap for the answers. "This is no good for me," said Charlie, 
    "I'll need a lot more paper." When time was up he handed in his pile of papers, mostly filled 
    with diagrams. Later he was notified that he and one other had been successful.
  </p>

  <p>
    Charlie belonged to Ngati Porou. But perhaps "belonged" is the wrong word, because Charlie was 
    his own man, wherever he was — army, iwi, hāhi. But he was greatly attracted to tough characters 
    like his own. Pa Teo (Fr Wanders) was a great favourite of Charlie's. Charlie's truck did many 
    miles to help Pa shift his gear from one parish to another. The minute he heard Pa Teo needed 
    help, he was there on the doorstep.
  </p>

  <p>
    Charlie would always help anyone down on their luck — by offering them a job. Pa Cushlow had 
    been plagued by a cunning scrounger who used to turn up late on Friday nights, when you couldn't 
    check his story. However this time Pa rang up Charlie who immediately offered him a job, even 
    though it was late at night. The scrounger went pale at the thought of work and we've never 
    seen him since!
  </p>

  <p>
    Turo Tepania and Charlie used to visit the sick together every night. At the Mater they would 
    say prayers over the intercom and finish up with a Maori hymn. Sister Claver and the patients 
    very much appreciated these visits.
  </p>

  <p>
    And there must be dozens of community projects around Auckland where Charlie helped by laying 
    drainage. On one of these projects he came across his old Commanding Officer from the Libyan 
    campaign, Harry Lambert. In Glendowie School the PTA and committee people asked Charlie to help 
    them re-laying drainage. In Harry's own words, "Charlie was willing and very able to supervise, 
    but after watching amateur navvies for a while he just had to take a more active part and for 
    several weekends he was chief navvy, chief supervisor and chief humorist — in all ways chiefly 
    and all for aroha."
  </p>

    After Maisie died, Charlie was lonely and didn't look after himself very well. Our Caretaker Dolly 
    and her husband Bunny, all tried to make him feel part of the family when he stayed at Te Unga Waka. 
    Then came the sad night when Charlie was crossing Manukau Road and was knocked down by a hit and run 
    driver. (Later the man owned up and was very remorseful.) After surviving all that war could throw at 
    him, in Libya and in Italy, it was tragic that he should die in suburban Auckland. But we all felt that 
    he had got to the stage where he didn't care much for life here on earth. Most of his friends were in heaven.
