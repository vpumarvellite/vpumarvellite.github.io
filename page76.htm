<h1>Greetings from Pa Mikaere Shirres</h1>

<p class="maori-greeting">Tena ra koutou e nga iwi te noho mai na i runga i nga kupu ohaki a o koutou tupuna.</p>
<p class="maori-greeting">Tena koutou e nga morehu waihotanga ake o nga iwi nunui o nehe i rere mai i Hawaiki, a i whakawhiti mai ki Aotearoa nei, ki tena takutai, ki tena takutai. Tena waka, tena waka, tena koutou katoa.</p>

<p>Te Unga Waka tena koe. For twenty-five years you have been te unga waka o Tamaki Makaurau. For many who have died in Tamaki Makaurau and elsewhere, you have been a resting place on their way home. No reira, e nga mate, ma te whetu ariki o te ao, koutou e arahi ki te tauranga pai, ki te "urunga e kore e whakaarahia hau kino".</p>

<p>For us, living in Tamaki Makaurau, you have been sometimes a resting place, and sometimes a place of very strong winds. I think of the strong winds at the time of the land march, and at other times as well.</p>

<p>In 1982 we joined Te Runanga Whakawhanaunga i Nga Hahi, the national Maori ecumenical body. "More and more you have come to know of Te Runanga and its commitment to Maori issues. Most importantly, they have perceived, in its Christian character, a sense of justice which gives credibility to the Gospel." It was Wiki Hotere who led us into full and equal partnership with Te Runanga Whakawhanaunga and members of Te Unga Waka who carried it through.</p>

<p>1983 saw the establishment of Te Runanga o Te Hahi Katorika ki Aotearoa, which owes much to the work of the people who were at that time the leaders of Te Unga Waka. From this there followed the consecration of Bishop Takuira Mariu as the first Maori Catholic Bishop.</p>

<p>In 1986 there was the Maori, not just Catholic, powhiri to Pope John Paul II, welcoming him to Aotearoa. The leaders of Te Unga Waka were responsible for that welcome. It took a lot of faith and guts to have the Maori right to welcome the Pope recognised, and the welcome itself so magnificently carried out.</p>

<p>This year is the year of the Maori Pastoral care Plan, now presented to the Bishops for their approval. Much of the detail of the Pastoral Care Plan and the Catholic principles on which it is based, can be found in the preamble and the objectives of the 1985 draft Constitution for the Auckland Catholic Maori Society, then based at Te Unga Waka.  I am sure there will be many more strong winds blowing around Te Unga Waka.</p>

<p class="maori-greeting">No reira, tena koutou me te matauranga! Tena koutou me te whakapono! Tena koutou me te aroha mau tonu!</p>
