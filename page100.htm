  <h2>MARAE COMMITTEE</h2>
  <p>
    To organise and cater for functions on the marae is a big task. Unless you've been involved, you can't imagine the continuous struggle to keep everything up to scratch. Every so often, an announcement is made in the weekly Newsletter, that volunteers are needed for making pillowslips, re-covering mattresses - and please bring you own sewing machine. There's floors to be polished and sometimes sanded and re-varnished. The kitchen and its equipment and the crockery have to be kept up to standard.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the beginning, the catering was done by the Komiti Wahine or another of the marae groups and it was only in February 1973 that the Komiti Marae was firmly established. At present the Marae Committee is essentially the same as the Housie Organising Committee, It has eighteen members who take on the job of fund raising, through Housie, Canteen, Raffles and other efforts. They are our main sources of income. These are quite distinct from Koha given by visiting groups.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Housie, Dolly and Lucia, with assistance from Moana Hotere, look after the main table. Marietta Rihari (Te Wake) and Marrion Lee are the Callers, while Sue Ball takes a rest from that job. The Floor-Walkers are Mahu Makiri, Pamela Norman and Eileen Chambers (Te Wake). In the kitchen, Nina and her daughter Geraldine join forces with Kathy Allen, Pauline Russell, Bonita Diamond and Dorothy Makiri. Diane Worwood and her daughters Geraldine and Tracey also join in where needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Early members of the marae committee were of course Auntie Puti and her whanau, which included Sonny Johnson and all his whanau, Charlie and Blue Shelford, Bubbles (Cecilia Lundon), Molly Houpapa, Tui Swannenbeck (Campbell) and Johnson Bristow. We pay our respects to the past Committees who gave so many hours of their time, without a thought of personal gain, in order to help the marae. A marae in the city has many more expenses than a country marae. The rates are a continual burden, and the services sends us huge bills, as though we were a money-making firm.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bubbles was one of the longest-serving Housie managers, followed by Manu Adams. For a time Uncle Eric and Dolly also put a lot of energy into running Housie, both Te Unga Waka and Avondale, Thursday and Friday nights. But patronage was falling off and Sonny Johnson suggested a change to Saturday afternoon and he agreed to manage it. Sonny, his family and the Te Atatu Committee had been running a very keen Housie in Te Atatu. But the very morning that he was due to take over, Sonny fell dead from a heart attack. What a tragedy! Sonny was one of that rare breed of people who are good managers, but kindly and gentle as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gemma Newson and Dorothy Makiri, Kevin Ngakuru and all his whanau all served on the Committee. Molly Houpapa and Annette ran the Canteen for quite a few years. Let's not forget the Secretaries, Lola and Rehu and now, Anna Hotere. Ex officio, the Runanga Secretary becomes the Marae Committee Secretary. And there's quite a few more helpers. Hope we haven't forgotten any of our "Regulars".
