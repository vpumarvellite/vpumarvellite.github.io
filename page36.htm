<h1>Our first Kaitiaki</h1>

<h2>Mr & Mrs Toia</h2>
<p>You only have to think how much time you spend trying to keep your own house clean, and then compare it with the huge size of Te Unga Waka. And it's not only keeping it clean, but also hiring it out and being hosts to manuhiri and looking after the kitchens and getting in the food supplies, etc, etc. Ka nui te mihi ki a koutou katoa. You have made our building into a real home. Kia ora.</p>

<h2>Housie</h2>
<p>Every Saturday afternoon it's "eyes down and looking" at Te Unga Waka. The House starts at 1pm, but if you want a place you will need to be there an hour or two early. It's a very popular sport. Some people disapprove of Housie and come up with all sorts of reasons. But as one old lady said, "This is a great game for relaxation. If you have got a worry on your mind, just buy an extra card and that will keep your mind from dwelling on your worries." Sounds good sense. As far as Te Unga Waka goes, it pays the bills.

So a big vote of thanks is due to those people who have given many hours of their time and worked on the Housie Committees. They are also responsible for raffles and other fund-raising activities which not only help Te Unga Waka, but draw together all the people who have its interests at heart.</p>

<p>Recently we inducted a new Secretary, Anna Hotere (Matiu and Lucy Hotere's daughter). We try to keep to Maori observances and so Anna was given a traditional welcome, with speeches and songs. One wonders if big business were to do this with their employees, whether it wouldn't make them feel part of the family. Interesting thought. At the very least, it would teach some of the stiff Anglo-Saxon types how to make a speech without falling over in embarrassment.</p>
