    A quarter of a century sounds like a long time. And it is a long time, because that’s the time it takes for a whole
    new generation to grow up. Luckily it doesn’t come all at once; it just grows on you bit by bit. So my first
    greetings go to all those people who have persevered – people who put themselves out, day by day, year by year,
    to keep up the spirit which started Te Unga Waka.
  </p>

  <p>
    Out here in the west of Auckland, we have the Avondale Catholic Maori Society. We can honestly claim to be steady,
    reliable supporters of Te Unga Waka right from the beginning. Father Tuerlings helped and encouraged us to use our
    love of gambling to support Te Unga Waka and at the same time help our own people.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I’d be telling a lie if I said we always saw eye to eye with members of Te Unga Waka Runanga. Perhaps they were
    living too high with God, whereas we were very much concerned with our own immediate problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    For over twenty years we have had an Education Committee to give help to families for education, books, uniforms
    etc. And also an Aroha Committee to help in times of tangi or when anyone was in hospital. When I was in hospital
    a couple of years ago I was bursting with pride to receive a great big bunch of flowers and a basket of fruit from
    our Aroha Committee. However, in my case, they gave me the bill as well, which sort of brought me down to earth!

    I want to pay my respects to those who have gone to their reward. Harry Tohu, one of our favourite callers was
    knocked down and killed, while still only a young man; Ken Moka also died young, of heart attack, while working
    hard preparing for the feast for his mokopuna’s Baptism.

  <p>
    And, of course, who could forget Sonny Johnson, a humble man and a great friend, a person who could organise things
    very well, yet always in a cheerful way. When (if?) you get to heaven, don’t look for Sonny on the speakers bench –
    you’ll find him in the kitchen, feeding the multitude.
