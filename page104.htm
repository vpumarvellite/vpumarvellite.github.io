  <h1>Kiri Te Kanawa</h1>

  <p>Dear Family of Te Unga Waka,</p>

  <p>Thank you for your recent letter, inviting me to contribute a message to your Silver Jubilee Magazine. I sincerely hope that it's not too late to send my greetings and encouragement to you all. I understand how important such occasions are to all Maori people. Four years ago I shared in the unforgettable reunion of the Te Kanawa Hapu in Te Kuiti on our family marae. We had a three day hui, with over two hundred of the family joining in.</p>

  <p>I see you had a nine day reunion and I'm sure it was a wonderful time to meet old acquaintances and talk over all the happy memories and also, of course, to say our farewells to those who are no longer with us.</p>

  <p>I am still grateful to you for forming the "Guard of Honour" at our Wedding and twelve days later, giving Desmond and myself a very happy "honeymoon" concert at Te Unga Waka.</p>

  <p>I remember taking part in such concerts in the early sixties to raise money for the Catholic Maori Centre, in school halls and parish halls and in the Maori Community Centre. It was an exciting time, with many great entertainers giving of their talents. There was Diane Winterburn, Hannah Tatana, Lou and Simon, George Tumahai and the Rangimarie group with their beautiful leader, Miria Hotere.</p>

Rangimarie members are Pat Smith, Manu Adams, Wayne Campbell, Weka Makiri, Miria Hotere, Edward Makiri, Pauline Russel, Whina Cooper, Milly Hotere, Martha Cash, and Mary (Kuia) Campbell.</p>

  <p>Sadly, some of them have left this earthly stage, Diane, George, Miria, Father v. Enckevort (Pa Matiu). Farewell – haere, e nga mate. Haere ki te waiata i te Kapa o nga Ahere. Haere, haere, haere.</p>

  <p>Please excuse me if I fail to mention anyone whom I should remember, but twenty-five years plays tricks with the memory. And my work takes me all over the world and far from friends in Aotearoa. Sadly, I have not lived there for many years. However I do enjoy my brief visits.</p>

  <p>I'm sure my Maori heritage has helped me to cope with various situations around the world. So, please, never lose the gift of laughter and song which is our Koha to the world.</p>

  <p>Aroha nui,</p>
  <p><strong>Kiri Te Kanawa</strong></p>
