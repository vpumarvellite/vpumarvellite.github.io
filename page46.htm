<h1>TRIPS WITH RANGIMARIE</h1>

<p>The trips with Rangimarie to present Christ the Maori were very tiring. But in spite of some arguments and grumbles that arose because of being so tired, we always managed to get them sorted out in time for the next trip; even though sometimes it took a ten-hour meeting to do so.</p>

<p>Two of these trips had a special significance for me.</p>
<p>a) The weekend in Mosgiel at the Seminary. The performance of Christ the Maori and the Miha Maori were magnificent. They made an immense impression on students, staff and the people of Mosgiel.</p>
<p>b) Our trip to Taumarunui. Before I came to Te Unga Waka I was stationed in Taumarunui for three years. Whilst I was there a beautiful new church was built. One of its features was a large Cross with Maori carvings standing over 20 feet high. The carvings were done by Archie Taiaroa (Hato Paora Old Boy) and his uncle George Anderson and myself. So, when the community there built a new Meeting House, I was asked to carve two poupou for it. By this time I was at Te Unga Waka.</p>

<p>Two big slabs of totara arrived and were put in the garage at 321 Manukau Road. So I started to carve and found I had a little helper. Our Housekeeper's daughter, Waimarie, was only a toddler at the time. She decided I needed her help and wanted to carve too. She became the best watchdog you would wish for. Nobody else was allowed to get near the carvings. Even if her mother Becky put her head round the corner, she would say, "Out! Out! Me and Fafa!" And if I didn't carve often enough for her liking, she would say, "Fafa, come, the Tongue". Her little mind had identified the challenging arero as something special; that became her name for them.</p>

<p>When we went to Taumarunui to perform Christ the Maori and have a Miha Maori, we took the carvings. They were all wrapped up because they were not to be exposed until the opening of the Meeting House. We learned that we should not carry them onto the marae in a horizontal position, because that is the position in which a dead person is carried. They had to be carried feet first, but with the head considerably higher than the feet.</p>

<p>In the speeches of the handing-over ceremony I mentioned that they were my children, born and grown under the shadow of Te Unga Waka, but that they should stay in the new Meeting House as their adopted children, and hence the bond between Te Taura-Whiri-a-Hinengakau and Te Unga Waka could not be broken.</p>

<p>Waimarie did not agree. On the way back she insisted, "Fafa! The Tongue! The Tongue!" She didn't like to leave them there. But if you go to the Meeting House in Taumarunui and see the two carvings with a cross in the hand, instead of the mere you know you are among friends. They are the children of Te Unga Waka - he whanaunga no tatou.</p>

<p>These are a few of many happy memories of my time at Te Unga Waka. It was very pleasant to come to the Jubilee and be among so many old friends again. Te Unga Waka gave me a very lovely time on the occasion of my Silver Jubilee as a priest and I want to thank you all for that. But the years don't stand still, and this year I have reached the milestone of forty years - the Ruby Anniversary. This time I am taking time off to celebrate it in the place where I was born, in the town of Tilburg in the south of the Netherlands. The Wahakapono has always been strong there. It has given many priests to the Mill Hill Fathers, and so I am proud of it and wish to share this occasion with those members of my family who are still alive. Ki ta te poroporoaki, "Mate kainga tahi, ora kainga rua" - but these days with jet travel and telephones and faxes and live T.V. the world has grown smaller and it's good to keep in touch with both sides. Tena ana koutou katoa, oku tini whanaunga i roto i te Whanau o te Hihi, o Te Unga Waka hoki. He nui nga mihi - Tena koutou, tena koutou, tena koutou katoa.</p>
