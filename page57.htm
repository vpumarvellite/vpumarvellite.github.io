<h1>JUBILEE WEEK</h1>

<p>"We'll be 25 years old in March!" "Yes, we'll have to do something about it. It only comes once." "Do you think many will come?" "How much will it cost?"</p>

<p>The Runanga was very conscious of the importance of the Silver Jubilee and appointed a committee with Eugene as Chairman, Miria Te Hau as Treasurer, Ada Harris as Secretary and Dick Harris as Vice Chairman. They would be responsible for raising funds, while Margaret Bohte, Urania Peita and Rehu Harris were the steering committee.</p>

<p>Eugene and his wife Liz spent many hours contacting groups around the city and arranging socials and raffles and anything that would make money. Te Rangimarie took on a new lease of life with Bernard Hotere as Chairman. His committee went to all former members to get their support and blessing. Our speakers, Dave King and Pat (Taria) Peita, Dick Harris and Paul Kanara were available, while Jack Peri and Manu Adams would be there for part of the time.</p>

<p>The response was slow at first. It was almost decided that two days Jubilee would be all that we could manage. Then along came Pa Henare to rouse the drooping spirits. NINE DAYS would be just right! It would give people and manuhiri time to come along, meet and enjoy the occasion. It would also give us time to look at different aspects of our Taha Maori and Taha Wairua.</p>

<p>Motuti brought along part of their Mission Museum - beautiful gold and silver chalices, monstrances and other sacred vessels and memorabilia used in earlier days. The Sisters of St Joseph kindly agreed to loan their permanent exhibition, showing the work of their Order and the changes in dress over the years. These were all housed in the dormitory.</p>

    <p class="caption">Mill Hill History</strong></p>

<p>In the Rangimarie Room there was a display of photos covering twenty-five years of Te Unga Waka and posters showing the history of the Mill Hill Fathers and their work in New Zealand. Some of us couldn't recognise ourselves in the skinny-looking characters of those days.</p>

<p>Our good friends Polly and Charlie Hovell and their daughter-in-law, Yvonne, came along to be Wardens for the week. They did a tremendous job, working really hard, guiding and helping people and keeping in check any high spirits. Freda Witana also brought her uniform and joined the force.</p>
