  <h1>AFTERMATH</h1>

  <div class="narrative">
    <p>The euphoria carried over from the day of the ordination. In modern psychology they would say we were "bonded". Ki ta te reo Maori, kua honoa tatou i a tatou hei whanau kotahi. To keep us united we needed another objective, and we had this in our sights, - our Maori Catholic Centre. Some critics say we should have thought "Marae" instead of "Centre" and then we would have had our Meeting House first. It may be true, but we were trail blazers for the city Maori. All the marae that we knew belonged to individual hapu. First and foremost we wanted a place where we belonged, where we could kick up our heels and dance and sing and play games. We had learned from the ordination that it was important to have your own hall and Turangawaewae.</p>

    <p>So the momentum carried on with Housie, Socials, Bring and Buys, Gambling (tut, tut!), legal raffles, illegal raffles. "Why not have a Queen Carnival for the little girls! Something short and sweet! Ha, ha!" So, in October, 47 little Princesses were sponsored by their families and friends. The target set for each was £10, because it would be a very short campaign for two weeks.</p>

    <p>Once more it was hustle and bustle, rushing here and there; croaky voices from smoke-filled Bingo sessions, "gamblers fingers" from spinning wheels and dealing cards; tired feet and tired eyes. Dame Whina was busy organising the spectacle. She had Joe Te Awhitu making the throne and thronelets. Rangimarie even made a trip to Thames to support Rose Marie Coromandel (Lulu Anderson's mokopuna). In the end, the Thames group triumphed and little Rose Marie led the procession into the Coronation. She had a train 52 feet long carried by the other 46 Princesses.</p>

    <p>There were trumpets and drums to give the appropriate fanfares. They were played by St. Peter's Epsom. Pa Kereti Aarts in red sash and black soutane performed the Coronation. Never mind that the crown fell off the first time. It didn't faze the young Queen at all. She was only four years old. Elizabeth Shelford of Manurewa and Maraea Matthews from the city were the runners-up. In just two weeks they had raised £1,466. (Extract from Te Waka o Hato Petera, Dec. 1962)</p>

    <p>For the record and that future generations may know the names of those who made this a carnival with a difference, we give the names of the Princesses, their sponsors in brackets, and place of origin. All deserve to be recorded for their wonderful efforts.</p>
