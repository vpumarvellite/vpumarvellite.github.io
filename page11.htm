    <h1>MILL HILL MISSIONARIES</h1>

    <p>
        In 1885 the Catholic Bishop of Auckland was a very worried man. He had just a few priests for this huge area from the north down to Taumarunui. So he wrote to Fr. Vaughan (later Cardinal) who had started a little society in the suburb of Mill Hill, north west London, about 20 years before. Could they spare anybody to come out and minister to the Maori people? He had only one old man in the north, Pa Maketanara, who moved from settlement to settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The young Society of St Joseph had undertaken work in the deep south of USA and Borneo, but he could spare a couple of priests for a start. So Fr. Becker (Pa Hoane Papita) and Fr. Madan (Pa Matana) were the first Mill Hill men to come to Aotearoa. They arrived in 1886. So began the relationship between Maori and Mill Hill which has lasted for over a century. In fact we had a big celebration at Te Unga Waka in 1986. This year too, Motukaraka is celebrating 50 years since the death of Pa Hoane Papita who is buried next to the Church which stands on the hill, overlooking the Hokianga river.

    <p>This is not meant to be a history of the Society, just a note to explain their position in the scheme of things. The philosophy of the Society was well suited to the Maori Mission. In the first Constitutions they were told to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn the language of the people</li>
        <li>Respect the tradition and culture</li>
        <li>Be independent of any politics</li>
        <li>Not buy land or property for themselves</li>
        <li>Be ready to work with their hands so as not to be a burden on the people</li>
    </ul>
