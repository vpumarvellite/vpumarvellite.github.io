<p>Special thanks to the Sister Disciples of the Divine Master who specialize in caring for sacred vestments. They cleaned and restored and gave advice for future care - all for aroha.</p>

<p>The evening entertainment was a Talent Quest and Floor Show. The panel of judges were Bob Newson, Winnie McMath and Annette Collier. Murray Korewha with his yodelling won the first prize; The Blister Trio (The Toko Sisters) were second and Nathan Warner was third.</p>

<p>Monday was programmed as a quiet day, with spiritual and theological lectures and a music workshop during the day. There were many positive comments about the Maori Theology lecture by Pa Shirres. Those of us who took part in the Music workshop found out that it's not all that easy to make new hymns, but we enjoyed the effort.</p>

<p>At 7pm we all gathered in the chapel for a Miha Whakamaharatanga. We remembered all the deceased, past members and pirihi of our marae and all the friends and relatives. Pa Henare had a list of over three hundred names. Ka hoki nga mahara ki a ratou, ka heke nga roimata, ka tangi pai nga waiata.</p>

<p>We were up early welcoming manuhiri and rushing about getting everything in order for the Jubilee Mass and the banquet to follow. Te Unga Waka was host for the day.</p>

<p>Seating was arranged in the foyer, and group after group was welcomed until Bishop Denis arrived with other VIPs at 10.30. Notice the smiles all around. What happy day it was! The church and foyer were packed and over twenty pirihi concelebrated with Bishop Denis.</p>
