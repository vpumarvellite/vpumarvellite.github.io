<h1>Administration & Chapel</h1>

<h2>General Administration Office</h2>
<p>The GENERAL ADMINISTRATION OFFICE is now next to the Chapel. Here all the administrative work is done by Secretary Rehu Harris and Treasurer Urania Peita. This is the Puta Honi with busy bees going in and out, and where the phones are always busy.</p>

<h2>Rangimarie Room</h2>
<p>Above the main Office is the RANGIMARIE ROOM. This was re-decorated and carpeted to make it a very comfy venue for small size meetings. It even has its own kitchenette.</p>

<p>Off the same stairs is an office which looks down on the Chapel. Originally it was designed as a "bawl-room", where people could take fractious children and still watch the Service below. But it wasn't popular so Pa Henare has made it his office now and does a lot of the administration side of his work from there.</p>

<p>Go on further up the stairs and you come to the DORMITORY which we used for our exhibition during the Jubilee Week. This is in constant use, with visiting groups using it as their base during a visit to Auckland. We've had groups from all over New Zealand and from just about every country round the world. With the new showers and toilets and use of the kitchen and dining room, it makes a very good "budget" home from home.</p>

<h2>Whare Karakia</h2>
<p>On the right, as you enter, is our Chapel. It was solemnly blessed exactly one year after Te Unga Waka was opened. From that time Mass has been offered there every day; 11 a.m. Sundays - Miha Maori, 8 a.m. weekdays. Only when there is a funeral or wedding is the schedule interrupted. For many of those years Yvonne and Des Rosser have been our faithful Katekita (Eucharistic Minister) for the morning Mass.</p>

<p>During Jubilee Week, our Chapel had pride of place, with all our activities centering around our spiritual home. The altar is made of slabs of totara, adzed into shape. Behind the altar is the Tabernacle. It's shaped to represent a seed, - the seed of the Word. When its outer doors are opened, the inner doors show the layers of a seed and from that seed rises the cross of the Saviour. It represents his words, "Unless the seed fall in the ground and dies, itself remains alone, but if it dies it produces much fruit." The figure of Christ on the cross is also represented in a mystical way which some people find strange. Recently we had a visit from a missionary who works with Australian Aborigines, and she was absolutely delighted with it and took several photos to show her people.</p>

<h2>Ngā Kaitiaki o te Whare</h2>
<p>On the corner of Clyde and Margot Streets is the house of the Caretaker. Dolly has had this job quite a few years now. She came here when husband Bunny was still driving buses. Unfortunately, he had to give up that job when fibrositis attacked his shoulders. Dolly may be small in size, but somehow she finds the energy to swish away with an enormous broom, as well as looking after her two mokopuna, Te Ahere and Te Aroha (oh, and her husband too).</p>

<p>Dolly's family is the seventh to take on the job of looking after the marae. Seven couples have given great service over the past twenty-five years.</p>
