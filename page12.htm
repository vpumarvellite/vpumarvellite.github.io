<h1>RELIGIOUS ORDERS</h1>

<p>
    We, in the city, have to thank the Religious Orders who have appointed their members to assist in the work of the Faith among the Maori people in Auckland. In the early days, the main help came from the Sisters teaching in the schools. They helped with religious instruction and did a certain amount of home visitation. They gave their holiday time to run the Catechism Camps. Many of our people attended schools run by the Marist Sisters, the Sisters of Mercy or the Sisters of St Joseph. St. Anne's Shelly Beach Road was also a focal centre, because many young Maori girls boarded there.
</p>
<p>
    In more recent times, Sisters have been appointed by the Orders for specific pastoral work in the city of Auckland. The Sisters of the Mission from Hato Hohepa, Crescentia, Phoebe, Mary Martin, Marie Chanel and Marie Andre have done valuable work, especially with their contacts with the Hato Hohepa Old Girls. The St Joseph's Sisters who have taught in our Maori schools for ages have become a strong part of our city team.
</p>
<p>
    Sister Fidelis, with many years experience in the schools of Panguru, Matata and Waihi-Tokaanu, adds a new dimension to the work in the city. Sr. Marie Hogan was with us for a while before being asked to work in Taranaki. Sister Edith has now come back to us and is "doing her thing - with guitar" in the Kohanga Reo of Te Unga Waka.
</p>
<p>
    The Sisters of Mercy have always given strong support to our people, through the schools and in recent years, by letting us have Sister Elizabeth (formerly Sister Zita) as leader of the Tamaki Mission Team. They also arranged for her to have a year of sacramental studies in Dublin, which, unfortunately, coincided with Te Unga Waka Jubilee Year.
</p>
<p>
    The Marist Brothers, through their work at Hato Petera, have always been ready to help Te Unga Waka. The Dominicans have supported Fr Michael Shirres in his many years of study at Auckland University, specializing in Maori Spirituality, which is now coming to fruition in Maori theology courses at Te Unga Waka. Many thanks, Sisters, Brothers, Pirihi.
</p>

    <p>
        Some people get very puzzled over the terms Religious and Diocesan. Aren't all priests supposed to be religious? Without getting too complicated: a Diocesan Priest is ordained for work in a particular area under the authority of the Bishop. He would usually be a local man but not always so.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Religious Priest belongs to one of the Religious Orders (or Congregations or Societies). All these Roopu have their own character and have usually been formed for a specific purpose; the members owe allegiance to each other and their Superior. Some specialize in education, others in giving Spiritual Retreats, others in working with racial groups. That is why, for example, Bishop Luck could invite the Mill Hill Fathers in 1885 and, more or less, leave the Maori work to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        All missionary societies in the course of time try to work themselves out of a job. They work so that eventually the people themselves will take over the work. That is why the Mill Hill Fathers were so happy when Pa Wiremu was ordained, then Pa Henare and the others who followed after him.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the past, the Bishop has appointed some of his young priest-trainees to do six months or more with the Tamaki Mission Team. That's how we got to know Pa Pateriki Dunne, Pa Petera Hay-McKenzie and Pa Piripi Sullivan. As well, each year, the Seminary course includes Maori studies in culture and language; not enough perhaps, but a help to greater understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, there's no substitute for our own Maori vocations. So we are praying and supporting Gerard Patterson and Peter Tipene as they gradually get nearer to the priesthood. (Peter's grandmother is mentioned in the article about the Legion of Mary. You can be sure she is praying for her mokopuna.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Pa Henare, of course, spent several years on the Tamaki Mission Team, where he was a great influence on the Youth, with Sports Teams and Social events. Now, he's back again after ministering to the people of the north and Gisborne.
