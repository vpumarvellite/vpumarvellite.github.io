<h1>Distinguished Guests & Catholic Women's League</h1>

<p>Some distinguished guests came to our first birthday party. I remember the cake was cut by Mrs Nieukerke, International President of the Pan Pacific and South East Asia Women's Organisations.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the Maori Women's Welfare League, I enjoyed working for our people and the company of Maori women. But, the spiritual aspect is missing. This is League policy, so that people from different religions can work together. I had been a member of another League, the Catholic Women's League, in Blockhouse Bay where we were living at the time.</p>

<p>In that group the spiritual aspect was missing. Very few Maori ladies felt at home with the formality and paper-work which seems to be necessary in a Pakeha setting. So a couple of us went to see Bishop Mackey to ask him if we could set up a Maori branch of the Catholic Women's League. "No, it's racism, June!" he said. "No, Bishop, it isn't! We want to do it our way, in our culture." That stopped him, and after a moment's thought he said, "I see what you mean." After that he was most helpful.</p>

<p>At this time we were learning what race relations meant. Some of our best friends took a while to see the difference between racism and living, praying and meeting in our own culture. Bubbles and I went to see Father Jim McGrath, whether we could have a Maori Mass in St Mary's, Avondale. Pa Tewano encouraged us to go along. Fr McGrath threw us out! He said, "Out! Out! That's racism."</p>

<p>When we got back home to Bubble's place, we rang Pa Tewano. "He threw us out!" "Ah" he said, so gently, "Don't worry. I'll go along and have a talk with him." And the most embarrassing day of my life was next day, when I came out of work. There was Fr McGrath waiting for me, and he said, "Can I talk to you June?" and he went on, "I want to apologise to you for last night." I felt really sorry for him. I said, "Oh, Father ...!" but from that time on, he really opened the doors. You wouldn't find a more helpful priest in the whole of Auckland. Their trouble was, they had not had much association with taha Maori and that's why they looked on it with suspicion at first.</p>

<p>So we started the Auckland Catholic Maori Women's League. Our motto: <em>Te Whakapono, Te Tumanako me Te Aroha</em>. Sister Marie Chanel was our first President and we had over twenty-five members. At first the rest of the C.W.L. gave us a hard time. It took them a long time to accept us. Their first reaction was the same as the Bishop — "Why be separate?" Even when we went Christchurch for the national meeting, they looked on us as deserters. But we persevered and gradually opinion changed. Now they are encouraging Samoan and other ethnic groups to set up branches of their own. They can now see the value of such groups.</p>

<p>We learned a lot from our Pakeha sisters, and, after some time, they began to appreciate the Maori input when we came together for national meetings. Aunt Martha (Cash) was very popular with them. They said how she flourished in a Maori setting. For several years the Treaty of Waitangi was on the agenda, and gradually the Pakeha members learned more about it and accepted it. And now, they have come out in support of the statement of the New Zealand Bishops on the Treaty.</p>

<p>Our group still meets at Te Unga Waka, which is central. Usually it's the third Monday of the month. But we adapt to suit the members, some of whom like Chrissie have many irons in the fire. Our numbers are very good. But we are sad at the loss of people like Sister Marie Chanel, Martha Cash, Sadie Hussey, Bella Harris, Emma and Tui.</p>
