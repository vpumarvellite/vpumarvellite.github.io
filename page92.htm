  <h1>He Kupu Mihi nā Pa Hoane</h1>

  <h2>From Father Dijkman</h2>

  <p>
    This Silver Jubilee, like other jubilees is an occasion
    to look back, – to look back on the 25 years of Te
    Unga Waka, on its history, on the events which make
    up its history and above all on the people who
    shaped its history. My greetings go out to them all, to
    those who are still alive and to those who have
    passed away. But these too live on among us in their
    achievements and in those who today share their
    hopes and their labours for the Maori of Auckland.

    At this time many will recall those events which to
    them were great occasions or moments to be
    treasured. They will be different moments for different
    people. I did not have much to do with Te Unga
    Waka, but my mind turns back to the induction of the
    Kaiarahi. Here was a group of people committing
    themselves to explore as Maori the message of Jesus
    anew, – to discover what it may have to offer to the
    Maori today, and to put it into practice in their own
    way, in a Maori way. Here was a group of people who
    were prepared to take a lead again. I think it created a
    general awareness, that the adult Maori must take
    responsibility in the church and, on behalf of the
    church, in the world, family community and society.
  </p>

  <p>
    My greetings go out especially to those people who
    spent so many evenings and weekends of hard, but
    rewarding study with me. It was a real challenge. But
    then I think, – a Maori is only a real Maori, when a real
    challenge is taken up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for all you shared with me during those
    hours. It was a great experience for me. And thanks
    to Te Unga Waka for providing the people, the
    opportunity and the facilities. Every hour spent in you
    was an hour of growth in understanding, a time of
    revealing to one another the riches of faith and
    culture. And I rejoice, that in years ahead, Pa Henare
    will lead you toward a much deeper appreciation.
  </p>

    Aroha nui, nā,
