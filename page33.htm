<h1>Te Unga Waka Today</h1>

<p>It's very difficult to make the outside of Te Unga Waka look attractive. Its best feature is the canoe which Morgan Puru carved and placed over the entrance. Thank you, Morgan also for the face-lift which you gave to the place before the Jubilee.</p>

<p>The enormous heavy doors look forbidding. They also wreck Dolly's back when she has to move them. Perhaps one of these days a young Maori artist, imbued with the spirit of our tupuna Maori, will come along and design a really special entrance - a beautiful Kuwaha which will draw you to it in welcome!</p>

<p>Every now and then we talk of getting a real Whare Whakairo to complete our buildings. What an asset that would be! No longer would we have to worry about shifting functions from the hall, especially the "Bread Winner", Housie. But for now it remains a dream.</p>

<p>Recently some of our tangihanga have been held in the recessed area of the chapel. With the benches removed and a suitable area prepared, there has been a certain warmth and atmosphere. Even in the main hall, with its huge size and many entrances, a small tangi can look and feel very lonely.</p>

<p>Where would we find enough money to build us a whare whakairo? We would want the best, although not necesaarily a big whare. The economic climate has got everyone worried. You've got to have some weird project before you get any grants. Perhaps it's time for us to remember our Heavenly Father and our loved ones who have gone ki tua o te arai. A big miracle - perhaps the best kind of miracle - one which takes place in the hearts of people and turns their minds and energies to the taha Maori and the taha Wairua.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Te Unga Waka tries very hard to make people feel welcome. A significant change was made last year. The storage space between the Foyer and the Sacristy has now been turned into an office and waiting room. Many of our V.I.P. visitors during the Jubilee were pleasantly surprised to find a carpeted room with nice chairs where they could wait while things were being prepared in the main hall.</p>

<p>In the past, when the offices were upstairs a caller could walk right through the Foyer, Hall and Kitchen and out to the back, without seeing anyone. Now, casual visitors see the light in the office, behind the pretty, white-laced curtains and smiling faces to welcome them</p>

<h2>Offices</h2>

<p>Across the hall there is a door which leads to four upstairs offices. At the moment one of them is the Communications Centre which we have named PUA KORERO (Pua = Blossoming or coming into flower; Korero = Communication). It may not be quite NASA CONTROL CENTRE but it has a computer and a photo-copier, filing cabinets and shelves of papers and pamphlets. There you'll find Zona May organising the archives, collating material and working on audio and visual resources. She is related to Aupouri, Ngati Kahu, Tuwharetoa, Ngati Hine and Ngapuhi. So there's no doubt she is sensitive to the tribal allegiances and differences which she meets in her work. Sometimes you will find husband Bernard Hotere there, helping when he can. Leonie Maxwell is co-ordinator and divides her considerable energies between Te Unga Waka and Whai Ora.</p>

<p>Another Office is occupied by the Social Services. We have named this group ROPU WHAKA-PIRIPIRI WHANAU (Group drawing families closer together.) This is a care-giving service in the areas of health and welfare for the families. Here they receive counselling, support and advice. Celia Pai is the contact person and overseer.  Her family is the Tatana whanau of Pawarenga, Herekino, Te Aupouri.  At present the other staff members are Sheyne Te Hau and Liz Harris.        They are still in training, learning all about the support work for families in strife, budgeting, court work. </p>
