<h1>Pa Matiu</h1>

<img src="/waka-83c.jpg" alt="Pa Matiu in Hokianga">
<p class="caption">Pa Matiu in Hokianga. The old bomb belonged to Pa Teo. It preferred the water-tables to the roads!</p>

<p>He had only brought a few items with him - and especially he missed his library of books. So Archbishop
McKeefry paid for him to have a quick return trip to pick up his gear. Then he went to live in Panguru, to learn
from Pa Teo and the people there, first of all language, and then customs, until he was appointed to the city of
Auckland, to help Pa Tewano.</p>

<p>We lived in Wilkinson Road for nearly ten years and Pa got on very well with all the South Auckland parishes. He
helped them all and in return they were very generous in allowing us the use of the parish halls for our
get-togethers.</p>

<p>In 1960, after ten years work, he went on leave to the Netherlands. While he was away, some of the people in
Glen Innes and Panmure started a fund. They had in mind the Ordination of Pa Henare which was getting
nearer. We wanted to give him a real Maori Feast, even if we had to feed the whole world. Father Laidler was filling
in for Pa Matiu at that time.</p>

<p>Pa Matiu liked to be very exact in everything. I can still see him crouching over his own sewing machine, the
night before Pa Henare's Ordination. He had just been over to Miria's to check the final pattern for the pari for
Te Rangimarie then he came straight back to 321 where we had five machines (including Pa's own).</p>

<p>If I remember right, the fund paid handsomely for Henare's Ordination and the extra was handed Archbishop
Liston to put into a special fund for our centre.</p>

<p>I won't go into all the details about the planning and building of Te Unga Waka. It was an exciting time for all of
us, with Queen Carnivals etc. The greatest thing to me was to see how the people pulled together, where before
they hardly knew one another. Pa Matiu was kept very busy interviewing architects, engineers and builders, as
well as his priestly work. When Te Unga Waka was being built he would take us along each evening, not just to
have a look, but to get busy shifting rubbish and doing what we could to help things along.</p>

<p>Of course he had his worries too. Sometimes he was gloomy, especially when he was snubbed by people he
was trying to help. You know what our people can be like sometimes. One old man (no names) told Pa Matiu
he'd never understand the Maori. Pa replied, "No, but I understand human nature!"</p>

<p>Pa Matiu eventually left Auckland. He was given spell in Taupo, ministering to Ngati Tuwharetoa. His health
wasn't good at this time and he spent time in Rotorua Hospital and recuperating in Orewa. Then he was asked
to take over Matata parish and I joined him there a few months later. He still had the urge to build. While he was
there he built a beautiful grotto to Our Lady.</p>

<p>In 1972 he retired to Blockhouse Bay and looked forward to enjoying his hobbies, like portrait painting. In the
end he died suddenly from a blood clot, the very day he was released from hospital. He left us in the middle of
planning a farewell trip to the Netherlands.</p>

<p class="maori-greeting">Haere, e Pa, haere ki ou hoa Pirihi, haere ki tou Iwi nui i te po. Haere, haere, haere.</p>

<p>We had a great tangi for him at Te Unga Waka. We all still think a lot of him. The portraits which he painted
remind us every day of a good man who left his home overseas to find a new home and family here.</p>
