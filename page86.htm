<h2>The Award Winner</h2>

<p>The Resurrection scene was magic, as the voices echoed our joy at the Rising of Christ. The start too was pretty special, with the coming of the canoes, from afar, from Hawaiki itself, implying that Redemption history didn’t just arrive with modern missionaries, but Christ’s grace extended to all waka. It was hard work, making sure we got the message across.</p>

<p>I can only remember once getting a puncture, but engine breakdowns did occur. It’s funny how often they happened near the sea, so that everyone could go for a swim. But it was the devil’s own job to get them back on the bus afterwards. I remember a funny incident on a trip north when we came to a roundabout. Round it went Pio in the lead bus, right around, followed by Manu and then Pat – talk about crazy – three big buses chasing each other round a roundabout!</p>

<p>Our kuia were marvellous companions on these trips. But there was a time when some of them nearly died with fright. Those who had never been to Hokianga before, thought the road had disappeared when they went up the Skyline. Poor Auntie Ka fainted and had to be revived. Mei Waru passed out after we descended, while she was still smoking! Someone’s skirt went on fire. But on the whole the memories of <em>Christ The Maori</em> are very happy ones.</p>

<p>There was plenty of other activities centred on Te Unga Waka. The whole Kaupapa was to help our Maori people, especially those who needed support, and draw them into our whanau. In the late 60’s we got our own branch of the Maori Women’s Welfare League. Auntie was the first President and Dame Whina was Patron. The Dame was National President at the time. I became involved later when Mira was President. The League did a lot of valuable work, especially for the young mothers. They were taught Preserving, Cooking, Gardening, Baby Care – things which are now called Living Skills. The League had a lot to offer and rallied round families in need, paying overdue power bills and teaching them to apply for benefits or to get decent housing. As the years went by we all became a bit more affluent and the young people didn’t want to learn about survival. They became used to buying tinned food and ready-made scones and cakes and clothes. Now times are getting hard again, it’s time they learned some of the old skills again.</p>

<p>For quite a few years Pio was Chairman at Te Unga Waka. During that time we learned a lot about the geography of Auckland, from Pukekohe to Wellsford as we tried to support our people in different parishes. I would often get a ring from a relation, calling us to tautoko them in some way.</p>
