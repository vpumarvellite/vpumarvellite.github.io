    <h1>Pa Wiremu Te Awhitu</h1>

    <p>They were very strong in their Whakapono. Some of the Katekita would lead the karakia o te Miha while the priest and alter-server said the Latin. When the weather was fine they all gathered in the playground to meet and hear news from home. Most people didn't yet have a phone. Baptisms and weddings and house-blessings were organised. Families still took babies back home to be "done" but quite a few Baptisms took place in St Patrick's Cathedral. Already people were saying: "Wouldn't it be nice to have a place of our own." But even by 1942 the total of Catholic Maori in Auckland is only 450.</p>

    <h2>Finance</h2>
    <p>On the whole our people are pretty pohara. Wages were good but city living was very expensive. We had plenty of nama, especially those who were buying their homes. There wasn't much loose cash. The Mill Hill Fathers live on the smell of an oily rag. Their personal allowance at this time was £15 a year.</p>

    <p>To finance the work of the Maori Mission in the Diocese of Auckland (which then also included the Hamilton Diocese), every parish was asked to have a special appeal each year. Bishop Liston asked dean Alink to provide Preachers to go and speak in a different parish every Sunday, to explain the work and the way the finances were to be used. Fathers Lagan, Wardle and Devolder took on this work and they even answered invitations to go and preach in the South Island. The money from these appeals helped to build schools in places like Pawarenga and Waihi-Tokaanu and also supported the missioners and the teaching Sisters.</p>

    <p>Dean Alink was very careful with the money and made it stretch as far as possible. But did he realise what a valuable asset a hall would be for the Maori people of Auckland. Bishop Liston supported the idea and got people to look out for somewhere suitable.</p>

    <h2>Pa Wiremu Te Awhitu</h2>
    <p>In December 1944 the Maori people celebrated a unique event. Pa Wiremu Te Awhitu was ordained in the Cathedral in Napier. He was the first Maori to reach the Turanga Tapu of the priesthood. His tribal connections branched out to nearly every tribe but his main allegiance was to Ngati Maniapoto, Wangaui, Ngati Tuwharetoa and Ngati Haua. He had studied at Hato Petera College when it still was a Catechist School. It was there that he felt the call of his vocation. Dean Alink helped and encouraged him. In those days the Church authorities were very, very cautious. Every candidate for the Catholic Priesthood was given a very strict training. Bishop Liston was more cautious than most. The best thing we can say about it was that he was anxious for Wiremu to be a success. Instead of accepting him for the Auckland Diocese, Bishop Liston thought it would be best if Wiremu joined an order like the Marist Fathers. They accepted Wiremu and gave him a very thorough and long period of training.</p>

    <h2>First Maori Catholic</h2>
    <p>But, finally, the great day arrived and Pa Wiremu received the sacred gift of the priesthood, in the Cathedral (since burned down). Dean Alink was Chaplain. Three weeks later he came to Auckland to celebrate his first Mass in St Patrick's Cathedral.</p>
