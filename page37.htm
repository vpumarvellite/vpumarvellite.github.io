<h1>What of the Future?</h1>

<p>Why was Te Unga Waka founded? What was the idea which started and sustained our elders to build this complex? We have to answer these questions in order to shape our future. As Tumuaki of the Runanga of Te Unga Waka, I feel this is a very big responsibility. It's not as if there aren't plenty of people giving us free advice. Unfortunately many of the loudest talkers have their own axes to grind.</p>

<p>Some of their suggestions are very dramatic, but to me, those people are like the opening speakers on the marae. They challenge everyone, sometimes with tremendous exaggeration. The speakers who follow, have the job of bringing the challengers down to earth, to the realm of the possible.</p>

<p>To me, the obvious reason for the founding of Te Unga Waka was to provide a Turangawaewae for our Catholic Maori Whanau in Auckland. The early Maori settlers in Auckland were very lonely sometimes, because they were scattered. At one stage it was Government policy (the Hunn Report) to make sure that the Maori didn't settle in single areas. If they wanted finance to build homes, they had to go along with the policy, called "pepper potting". Just sprinkle the Maori around, like pepper on your kai, and they will become pakeha.</p>

<p>In their country homes, they had marae and church; sometimes it was the same thing. And these were the things they missed most in the city. I know this all sounds a bit too obvious, but we have to state the obvious over and over again, to guard against people who would like to hi-jack our centre for their own purposes.</p>

<p>There's plenty of people who would like to push out the influence of the church, for example. They come up with the old chestnuts about the Faith being something alien, about Missionaries being greedy land-grabbers. My favourite Pirihi Kaumatua, Pa Aterea (Father Zangerl), gave us his life and only took six feet of earth in return!</p>

<p>On the contrary, I would say that the church-whanau was a unifying strength. In the country we have ties of blood to unite us; each marae belongs to a family or group of families. But in the city, with people coming from East, West, North and South, this binding force is absent. Our blood relationship is replaced by the unifying blood of Christ. Iwi who would have been fighting in earlier days, now work together and help and respect each other. Life-styles and entertainment have totally changed since the fifties and sixties, but I think the basic concept of church and marae is still valid.</p>

<p>Every so often our kuia, Auntie Whina, descends on us. She shakes her stick at us and demands to know if we're doing anything and why not ?! No one dares to tell her, because if their opinions are different from the Dame's, they will be attacked, verbally, with great ferocity, and all our ignorance will be revealed for everyone to hear.</p>

<p>We respect the old lady. She is a necessary part of the Maori process. She challenges everyone, her dramatic performance no one can beat. But just as she needed Mira, during her days as the President of the Maori Women's Welfare League, so now she needs a person to tautoko her ideas and bring them down to practical details now.</p>

<p>I am always suspicious of sudden changes of direction. To me Te Unga Waka is like a well made car. It has times when it goes a bit slow, and sometimes we the drivers, are not very expert; but the potential is there. I am very proud of the spiritual side of Te Unga Waka. Where else in Aotearoa has there been a Miha Maori every Sunday for the past 25 years? And a morning Mass every week-day. As well as daily spiritual nourishment, there are social services available, budgeting advice, MACCESS COURSES, Kohanga Reo and in the evenings such varied subjects as Maoritanga tuition, Rangimarie practices, Maori theology, meeting of Iwi groups who look upon Te Unga Waka as their base.</p>



<p>People from just about every country in the world have stayed at Te Unga Waka; Canadians, Peruvians, Australians, Russians, Americans, Irish, Malays, Hawaiians, all the Pacific Islands; sports teams, cultural competition teams; groups on their way to and from Waitangi Days; Maori Orchestras; canoe teams; Australians.</p>

<p>The main financial support comes from the Saturday Housie. We owe a debt of gratitude to our Housie Committee. They produce the regular income to pay the Rates and Power Bills etc. They give freely of their own time. And the same few dedicated people also organise other fund-raising events. We're proudly independent — we don't owe any nama and we don't want free hand-outs. But we do appreciate new faces and new families — they strengthen us — we strengthen them.</p>

<p>Finally a word of thanks to the many groups around the big city who share with us from time to time. Some of them had their origins in Te Unga Waka but have now grown into strong centres themselves. No reira, he mihi whanui tenei ki a koutou katoa, o matou tuakana, teina. Tena ra koutou katoa, huri noa Tamaki Makau Rau, Tena koutou, tena koutou katoa. Aroha nui,</p>
